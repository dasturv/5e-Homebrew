				Druid: Circle of Shifting Sands
			</div>
			<p>
				<strong><em>
					<p>Druids of the circle of shifting sands emulate harsh deserts, channeling their unstable and dangerous natures. These druids are not cruel, but merely see life as a fleeting and difficult thing, something that must be strived to maintain and is often lost to an uncaring cosmos. These harsh truths, much like the desert, is difficult for many to stomach, but to these druids, there is beauty in this nihilistic view.</p>
				</em></strong>
				<h3>Circle Spells</h3>
				<p>Your spiritual connection to the harsh deserts and your ability to tap into their power grants you access to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mold-earth">Mold Earth</a> cantrip. If you already know Mold Earth, you instead learn a druid cantrip of your choice.</p>
				<p>At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of Shifting Sands Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>

				<h3>Scouring Sands</h3>
				<p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to conjure a small sandstorm in the form of a whirling column of sand. As a bonus action you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to create the the sandstorm in a space within 30 feet of you, rather than transforming into a beast form. The sandstorm is a column with a 5 foot radius and a height of 10 feet. The sandstorm is considered difficult terrain for creatures hostile to you.</p>
				<p>Each creature of your choice within the sandstorm when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your Druid spell save DC or take damage from the sandstorm. The sandstorm deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage.</p>
				<p>Once on each of your turns you may use a bonus action to cause the sandstorm to move up to 20 feet in any direction. At the end of the movement, each creature of your choice within the sandstorm must succeed on a strength saving throw or take damage from the sandstorm.</p>
				<p>The sandstorm lasts for 10 minutes, until you dismiss it as a bonus action or you use your Wild Shape again.</p>

				<h3>Shifting Steps</h3>
				<p>Starting at 6th level, your affinity for the unstable ground of your homeland makes you more elusive in battle. Attacks of opportunity made against you are made at disadvantage.</p>

				<h3>Empowered Storm</h3>
				<p>Also at 6th level, the damage die of your sandstorm increases to 1d8. It increases again at 10th level (1d10) and finally at 14th level (1d12).</p>

				<h3>Vengeful Sands</h3>
				<p>At 10th level, the harmful effects of your sandstorm has increased. The radius of the sandstorm increases to 10 feet and its height to 20 feet. Additionally, whenever a hostile creature within the sandstorm is reduced to 0 hit points, you may use your reaction to cause each creature of your choice within it to make a Strength saving throw against your Druid spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes your sandstorm's damage.</p>

				<h3>Desert's Shroud</h3>
				<p>At 14th level, your sandstorm shelters and protects: you and your allies have half cover while within your sandstorm.</p>
