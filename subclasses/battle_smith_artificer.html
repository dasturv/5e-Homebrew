			<p>
				<strong><em>
					This subclass is an extension/rework of the vanilla battlesmith, allowing more options for the artificer to bring it in line with the ranger's beast master conclave. Unless otherwise stated, use the features from the <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/artificer:battle-smith">Battle Smith</a> specialization.
				</em></strong>

				<h3>Steel Companion (Optional)</h3>
				<p>This 3rd-level feature feature replaces the Steel Defender feature.</p>
				<p>By 3rd level, your tinkering has borne you a faithful companion, a steel companion. It's friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. Choose its stat block-Steel Defender, Steel Hunter or Steel Scout-which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You determine the creature's appearance. your choice has no effect on its game statistics.</p>
				<p>In combat, the companion acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</p>
				<p>If the Mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. If it has died within the last hour, you can use your smith's tools as an action to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The steel companion returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.</p>
				<p>At the end of a long rest, you can create a new steel companion if you have smith's tools with you. If you already have a companion from this feature, the first one immediately perishes. The companion also perishes if you die.</p>

				<p>This 15th-level feature feature replaces the Improved Defender feature.</p>
				<p>At 15th level, the extra damage and the healing of your Arcane Jolt both increase to 4d6. Additionally, your steel companion becomes more powerful, based on the form it takes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Steel Defender.</strong> Your steel defender gains a +2 bonus to Armor Class. Additionally, whenever it uses its Deflect Attack, the attacker takes force damage equal to 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier.</li>
					<li><strong>Steel Hunter.</strong> Your steel hunter's walk speed is increased by 10 feet. Additionally, whenever it uses its Multiattack, it makes three Force-Empowered Blade attacks instead of two.</li>
					<li><strong>Steel Scout.</strong> Your steel scout's darkvision range increases by 60 feet (to a total of 120 feet). Additionally, whenever you or your scout deals damage to the target of its Lock Target ability, that target takes an additional 1d6 force damage.</li>
