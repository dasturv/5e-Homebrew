				Sorcerer: Abyssal
			</div>
			<p>
				<strong><em>
					Sometimes the magic of a sorcerer comes less from a spark, and more from a void within their soul. Connected to the ceaseless hunger and fell magics of the Abyss and the demons that dwell there, such a sorcerer is as cursed as they are blessed by power. Whether formed by a blasphemous ritual on an unborn child, or through a bloodline connection to Demons or cultists, an Abyssal sorcerer wields their hunger as a weapon.
				</em></strong>

				<h3>Abyssal Legacy</h3>
				<p>At 1st level, you can speak, read and write Abyssal. In addition, you learn the <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:inflict-wounds">Inflict Wounds</a> spell. This spell is a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against your number of sorcerer spells known.</p>

				<h3>Unholy Fortitude</h3>
				<p>As the fell influence of the Abyss infuses your being, it enhances your resilience. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.</p>
				<p>Additionally, patches of your skin are covered by strange growths like scales, horns or scabby hide. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.</p>

				<h3>Ruinous Hunger</h3>
				<p>Starting at 6th level, you can feed on the suffering of your defeated foes. Whenever a creature of significant threat is reduced to 0 hit points while within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + half your sorcerer level (rounded down, minimum of 1).</p>
				<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>

				<h3>Grisly Transformation</h3>
				<p>At 14th level, you can use your magic to deepen your connection with the abyss, tranforming in unpredictable and horrifying ways. As a bonus action you can spend 1 to 4 sorcery points to magically transform your body for 10 minutes. For each each sorcery point you spend, roll a d12 on the table below, gaining the effect associated with the number you roll. If you roll an effect you already have, you instead choose an effect you don't have. The effects last for the duration of the transformation.</p>

			<h3>Ravenous Void</h3>
			<p>By 17th level, your ceaseless hunger is so complete, you can feed upon the souls of your foes before they die. As an action you can expend 5 sorcery points and make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, that creature takes 6d10 necrotic damage and you regain hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt. If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points using this feature, you regain 5 sorcery points.</p>
			<p>Once you deal damage to a creature using this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
