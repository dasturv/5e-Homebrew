				Bard: College of Hope
			</div>
			<p>
				<strong><em>
					Bards who study within the College of Hope seek to bring light and life to the darkest and most dangerous corners of the world. Taught to inspire courage and conviction within those around them, these bards use their magic to push back all that is evil.<br><br>
					The bards of this college are seen as saviors and champions of the downtrodden. They are often found on the frontlines of conflicts, whether that be facing off against a tyrannical noble or on the battlefield. Their performances are legendary for pushing those who hear them to acts of heroism and might far beyond what they ever believe they could achieve.

			<h3>Frontline Training</h3>
			<p>When you join the College of Hope at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor and shields.</p>

			<h3>Inspire Conviction</h3>
			<p>Also at 3rd level, you gain the ability to fill others with dedication so fierce, they can push though the direst of situations.</p>
			<p>As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to grant a creature you can see within 60 feet of you temporary hit points equal to one roll of your bardic inspiration dice plus your bard level. While a creature has these temporary hit points, they have resistance to all damage.</p>

			<h3>Warding Performance</h3>
			<p>Starting at 6th level, your ability to thwart the effects of magic is increased. While using your Countercharm feature, you and friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit.</p>

			<h3>Ceaseless Hope</h3>
			<p>By 14th level, the hope you inspire even pushes back against death itself. As a reaction when you see another creature within 30 feet of you be reduced to 0 hit points (but not killed outright), you can cause that creature to instead be reduced to 1 hit point and recover a number of hit points equal to three times your bard level.</p>
			<p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
