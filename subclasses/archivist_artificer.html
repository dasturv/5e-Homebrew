				Artificer: Archivist (Rebalanced)

			<p>
				<strong><em>
					This subclass is an rework of the unearthed arcana archivist. What are the best ways to store vast amounts of information? That question has occupied chroniclers and librarians for centuries. Scrolls and books were the finest information-storing methods for a long time, but the first Archivists imagined something greater: storing information in a real or an artificial mind. What library could match a mental archive capable of accessing information in seconds? As they work towards this goal, Archivists have become masters of storing knowledge and creating artificial intelligences fueled by magic. These techniques have yet to be perfected and institutionalized, and of all artificers, archivists are on the cutting edge of arcane science.

				<h3>Tools of the Trade</h3>
				<p>By the time you adopt this specialty at 3rd level, you’re deeply familiar with employing its tools.</p>
				<p><strong>Proficiencies.</strong> You gain proficiency with calligrapher’s supplies and the forgery kit. If you already have one of these tool proficiencies, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.</p>
				<p><strong>Crafting.</strong> If you craft a scroll, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold.</p>

				<h3>Archivist Spells</h3>
				<p>Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Archivist Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don’t count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.</p>

				<h3>Artificial Mind</h3>
				<p>At 3rd level, you discover how to awaken or create an artificial intellect. The mind is a Tiny magical object, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. You determine what the object is and its appearance.</p>
				<p>While the item is on your person, you gain the following benefits:</p>
				<p><strong>Telepathic Advisor.</strong> The artificial mind telepathically supplies you with advice and information about certain topics: you have proficiency in two skills of your choice. You can change one or both of these proficiencies whenever you complete a long rest.</p>
				<p><strong>Manifest Mind.</strong> As a bonus action you can cause the mind to manifest as a Tiny spectral presence, hovering in an unoccupied space of your choice within 60 feet of you. This presence is intangible and invulnerable, and it sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. You determine its appearance. While manifested, the spectral mind can hear and see, and it has darkvision with a range of 60 feet. The mind can telepathically share with you what it sees and hears (no action required).</p>
