				<strong><em>
					This subclass is an rework of the unearthed arcana archivist. What are the best ways to store vast amounts of information? That question has occupied chroniclers and librarians for centuries. Scrolls and books were the finest information-storing methods for a long time, but the first Archivists imagined something greater: storing information in a real or an artificial mind. What library could match a mental archive capable of accessing information in seconds? As they work towards this goal, Archivists have become masters of storing knowledge and creating artificial intelligences fueled by magic. These techniques have yet to be perfected and institutionalized, and of all artificers, archivists are on the cutting edge of arcane science.

				<h3>Tools of the Trade</h3>
				<p>By the time you adopt this specialty at 3rd level, you’re deeply familiar with employing its tools.</p>\
				<p><strong>Proficiencies.</strong> You gain proficiency with calligrapher’s supplies and the forgery kit, assuming you don’t already have them.</p>
				<p><strong>Crafting.</strong> If you craft a scroll, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold.</p>
