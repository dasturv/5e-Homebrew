				Warlock: Great Wyrm
			</div>
			<p>
				<strong><em>
					Within the world there are dragons, mighty and powerful beings who wield immeasurable arcane might. And then there are the Great Wyrms. These ancient beings have neared divinity with their power, and have the ability to share a tiny fraction of it with their followers. The Great Wyrms vary wildly with their motivations and aims, but many find having mortal servants to deal with threats not worth their individual time most useful.
				</em></strong>

				<h3>Expanded Spell List</h3>
				<p>At 1st level, the Great Wyrm lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The Great Wyrm Expanded Spells table shows the dragon spells that are added to the warlock spell list for you, along with the spells associated in the table with your patron's kind: chromatic, gem or metallic.</p>

				<h3>Unholy Fortitude</h3>
				<p>As the fell influence of the Abyss infuses your being, it enhances your resilience. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.</p>
				<p>Additionally, patches of your skin are covered by strange growths like scales, horns or scabby hide. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.</p>

				<h3>Ruinous Hunger</h3>
				<p>Starting at 6th level, you can feed on the suffering of your defeated foes. Whenever a creature of significant threat is reduced to 0 hit points while within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + half your sorcerer level (rounded down, minimum of 1).</p>
				<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>

				<h3>Grisly Transformation</h3>
				<p>At 14th level, you can use your magic to deepen your connection with the abyss, tranforming in unpredictable and horrifying ways. As a bonus action you can spend 1 to 4 sorcery points to magically transform your body for 10 minutes. For each each sorcery point you spend, roll a d12 on the table below, gaining the effect associated with the number you roll, rerolling if you get an effect you already have. The effects last for the duration of the transformation.</p>

			<h3>Ravenous Void</h3>
			<p>By 17th level, your ceaseless hunger is so complete, you can feed upon the souls of your foes before they die. As an action you can expend 5 sorcery points and make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, that creature takes 6d10 necrotic damage and you regain hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt. If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points using this feature, you regain 5 sorcery points.</p>
			<p>Once you deal damage to a creature using this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
