				Wizard: Theurgy (Reworked)
			</div>
			<p>
				<strong><em>
					A number of deities claim arcane magic as their domain, for magic is as much a part of the fabric of the cosmos as wind, fire, lightning, and all other primal forces. Just as there are deities of the sea and gods of warfare, the arcane arts feature their own divine patrons.<br><br>
					Such deities often have clerics, but many gods of magic bid their followers to take up the study of wizardry. These religious magic-users follow the arcane tradition of Theurgy, and are commonly known as theurgists. Such spellcasters are as dedicated and scholarly as any other wizard, but they blend their arcane study with religious devotion.
				</em></strong>

				<h3>Divine Inspiration</h3>
				<p>Beginning when you select this tradition at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the Religion skill, and you learn one cantrip from the <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:cleric">cleric spell list</a>. For you this cantrip counts as a wizard spell.</p>

				<h3>Divine Magic</h3>
				<p>Also starting at 2nd level, your link to the divine allows you to learn spells normally associated with the cleric class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn a wizard cantrip or add or replace a wizard spell between 1st level or higher in your spellbook, you can choose the new spell from the <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:cleric">cleric spell list</a> or the <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:wizard">wizard spell list</a>. You can only add cleric spells of 5th level or lower in this way, and must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell.</p>
				<p>Additionally, you may copy cleric spells that between 1st level and 5th level (inclusive) into your spellbook, using the regular rules for copying a spell into the book.</p>
				<p>Any cleric spell you gain from this feature is considered a wizard spell for you, but other wizards canâ€™t copy cleric spells from your spellbook into their own spellbooks.</p>

				<h3>Channel Arcana</h3>
				<p>At 6th level you gain the ability to channel the arcane energy from your deity to empower your spells. Once per turn when you roll to deal damage or restore hit points to a creature with a wizard spell, you may gain a bonus on that roll equal to half your wizard level. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>
				<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can use this feature twice between rests, and beginning at 14th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>

				<h3>Spell Breaker</h3>
				<p>Starting at 10th level, when you restore hit points to an ally with a spell of 1st level or higher, you can also end one spell of your choice on that creature. The level of the spell you end must be equal to or lower than the level of the spell slot you use to cast the healing spell, and you can only end one spell per casting.</p>

				<h3>Divine Mastery</h3>
				<p>At 14th level, you choose three spells from the <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:cleric">cleric spell list</a>, one from each of the following levels: 6th, 7th, and 8th. You add them to your spellbook. These spells are considered wizard spells for you, but other wizards can't copy them from your spellbook into their own spellbook.</p>
				<p>Whenever you can replace a spell in your spellbook, you may instead replace one of these spells with a cleric spell of the same level.</p>
