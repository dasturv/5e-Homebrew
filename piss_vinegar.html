				Pugilist: Piss and Vinegar
			</div>
			<p>
				<strong><em>
					Pugilists who follow the teachings of the Piss and Vinegar fight club revel in their reputation as heels. Widely despised for their obscene curses and dirty tricks, these pugilists take pride in their ability to provoke others, and fight to win at all costs.
				</em></strong>
				<h3>Foul Tongued</h3>
				<p>When you choose this fight club at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill if you don't have it already. If you do, you gain proficiency in your choice of the Deception or Sleight of Hand skills.</p>
				<h3>Salty Salute</h3>
				<p>Also at 3rd level, you have mastered the art of the enraging insult, and revel in the anger you cause. You can use a bonus action to attempt to provoke a creature within 30 feet of you who can see and hear you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your moxie save DC. On a failure the creature becomes enraged at you for one minute. While enraged in this way, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls that do not include you as a target. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Regardless of if the creature succeeds or fails, you gain temporary hit points equal to one roll of your Fisticuffs die plus your Constitution modifier.</p>
				<p>Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short rest or expend 2 moxie points to use it again.</p>
				<h3>Dirty Tricks</h3>
				<p>Starting at 6th level, you learn some nasty tricks to help you out in a fight. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike you can spend 1 moxie point and choose one of the tricks below to apply to the attack. If the target of a trick is enraged due to your Salty Salute feature, that trick instead costs no moxie points.</p>
				<p><strong>Heelstomper.</strong> You attempt to halt the movement of your target. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your moxie save DC. On a failure, the creature's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn.</p>
				<p><strong>Low Blow.</strong> You attempt to drop your target with a blow to a sensitive area. The creature must make a Strength saving throw against your moxie save DC. On a failure, the creature drops prone.</p>
				<p><strong>Pocket Sand.</strong> You attempt to blind your target with loose soil or small object. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw against your moxie save DC. On a failure, the creature is blinded until the end of its next turn.</p>
				<p>Each trick can only be used once per turn, and each creature can only be effected by one trick per turn.</p>
				<h3>Mean Old Cuss</h3>
				<p>By 11th level, your insults become even more malicious and mean-spirited. Whenever a creature fails the initial save of your Salty Salute feature or starts its turn enraged at you due to your Salty Salute feature, it takes psychic damage equal to one roll of your Fisticuffs die.</p>
				<h3>The Uncouth Art</h3>
				<p>Staring at 17th level, you gain the ability to offend the entire room with minimal effort. When you use your Salty Salute feature, you can spend 1 to 5 additional moxie points. For each moxie point spent this way, you can target an additional creature using your Salty Salute feature. Additionally, you gain temporary hit points equal to a number of rolls of your Fisticuffs die equal to the number of creatures targeted this way, plus your Constitution modifier instead of the temporary hit points you gain from your Salty Salute feature.</p>
				<p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
