				Pugilist: Marked Hand
			</div>
			<p>
				<strong><em>
					For some pugilists, their fame or infamy draws more than the attention of mere mortals. Whether by drawing the attention of an eldritch being inadvertently through feats of immense prowess or by seeking out such a force, a Marked Hand is more than a mere fighter. Regardless of if the Marked Hand is a willing servant of their patron or bitter slave, they are bestowed with eldritch power that enhances their abilities.

				<h3>Eldritch Patron</h3>
				<p>When you reach 3rd level, you become marked by an eldritch being of your choice:</p>

				<h3>Moxie Magic</h3>
				<p>When you choose this fight club at 3rd level, your connection with your patron allows you to augment your combat techniques with the ability to cast spells. The spells you can learn can be found on the Warlock spell list.</p>
				<p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn an additional warlock cantrip at 11th level.</p>
				<p><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong> Strength is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, since your patron only grants you powers due to your physical might. You use your Strength whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Strength modifier when making an attack roll with a warlock spell you cast. If a warlock spell requires a saving throw, you use your moxie save DC.</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier.</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier</p>
				<h3>Eldritch Brand</h3>
				<p>Additionally at 3rd level, you are branded by your patron, granting you strange and powerful abilities. Your patron's brand usually takes the form of a symbol or mark branded on your skin, though some patrons prefer alternative ways of showing their influence.</p>
				<p><strong>Eldritch Resistance.</strong> You gain resistance to the damage type associated with your Eldritch Patron.</p>
				<p><strong>Elemental Strikes.</strong> When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or a pugilist weapon, you can deal an additional 1d4 damage of the damage type associated with your eldritch patron to the target. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.</p>
				<p>This feature's extra damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 11th level and 1d10 at 17th level.</p>
				<p><strong>Eldritch Fisticuffs.</strong> Whenever you cast a cantrip, you can make an unarmed strike as a bonus action.</p>

Alternatively, you can expend 1 moxie point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action instead.</p>
