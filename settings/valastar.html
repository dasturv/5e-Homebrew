			<p><em>Georgie gripped onto the crumbling stone railing, his stomach reeling. He looked up, through the criss-crossing bridges of the warrens and saw a faint golden light. Sunlight, he was told it was called. It seemed unnatural to him, how could some orb in the sky make light? He breathed deeply and looked down, towards the crimson light of the furnaces below. The sight of his home with its comforting flames steeled him as he got up. He looked up again. If he was going to save his sister, he better get used to this whole "open air" thing...</em></p>

			<h3 id="overview">An Urban World</h3>
			<p>The world of Valastar consists of a singular, impossibly large city of the same name. Built atop its own crumbling ruins, the city of Valastar reaches far above the dark clouds below, and far above any known ground below, it's sides falling endlessly into the void. There is no wilderness, only forgotten corners of the impossibly large city. The city itself is deeply stratified, both literally and figuratively, with the lower and older levels housing the less fortunate citizens and more dangerous trades.</p>
			<p><strong>The Spires.</strong> Standing proudly above the rest of the city are a series of mighty towers, home to the truly wealthiest and most affluent members of Valastar's society. Reaching even above the artificial clouds of the Garden and Gilded City below, the eternal day is never broken for the residents of the Spires.<br>
			<strong>The Gilded City.</strong> Beautiful architecture of white stone, gold and brass makes up the Gilded City, home to wealthy citizens and politicians. The sprawling city boasts many parks and manors, and serves as the political center for all of Valastar.<br>
			<strong>The Garden.</strong> Massive platforms reach out over the void from the Garden, with vast fields of grain and produce grown using the endless sunlight and rain from artificial clouds. The Garden provides the majority of fresh food for the city, at least for those who can afford it. The citizenry of the Garden subsists of the owners of land and successful businesses, enjoying the rays of sunlight peaking through the clouds and towers above.<br>
			<strong>The Warrens.</strong> Overcrowded and bleak, the Warrens are where the vast majority of Valastar's overworked, malnourished populace live in quiet desperation. Barely any sunlight reaches the Warrens, with only those nearest the Garden seeing natural light with any regularity. The citizens living within the Warrens are most often laborers for the Garden above or the Furnaces below, sprinkled with small business owners, low ranking law enforcement and successful criminals.<br>
			<strong>The Furnaces.</strong> Metal pipes breaking through ancient architecture, the hellish red glow of fire and flux, and the constant, deafening sounds of industry define the Furnaces. The industrial heart of Valastar, the Furnaces are an incredible vast series of factories and refineries that transform the arcane substance known as flux into the raw materials required for the city to run. Violent accidents and crime are common here, with the truly destitute carving out homes in broken ruins between the factories.<br>
			<strong>The Undercity.</strong> Only the truly desperate try and make a home in the Undercity. Only lit by the faint flickering of the Furnaces above, the Undercity has virtually no laws nor structure. Criminals seeking to escape justice or vengeful rivals, people who have lost everything to debtors, and the truly destitute and discard by society call the Undercity home. Violence, death and disappearences are commonplace here, and everyone here wants out.<br>
			<strong>The Abyss.</strong> No light exists in the Abyss. Made of ancient architecture long forgotten, the city itself seems almost alive this deep. Pathways change themselves, people hear whispers and screams, horrid abominations stalk dark paths and ruins. Only the bravest or most foolhardy delve into the Abyss, and most never are seen again.</p>
			
			<h3>Unknown Origins</h3>
			<p>Whatever the city was, or who built it are facts long lost to the ravages of time. For as long as history records, scholars of Valastar have attempted to unravel the mysteries of the past, though every discovery made has done little but provide more questions.</p>
			<p><strong>Flux.</strong> The mysterious crimson substance know as flux, the lifeblood of Valastar, comes up from massive metal pipes that stab into the bottomless Abyss, with any attempts to find their source being met with tragedy. The great machines and templates the citizenry uses to mold flux are impossibly ancient, with the understanding behind them lost. The people of Valastar know these arcane machines work, but not how, making innovation and repairs near impossible.<br>
			<strong>A Rising Darkness.</strong> The affluent of Valastar have always attempted to build further and further into the sky, and yet, the city itself has never seemed to grow larger. The Abyss slowly but steadily eats away at the lowest levels, claiming ever more city into itself.<br>
			<strong>Endless Day.</strong> There is no day or night in Valastar. The sun sits directly overhead, above the city itself, never moving nor setting. It is only the city itself, alongside the dark roiling clouds beneath the Garden that blocks light from reaching the destitute citizens below.</p>
			
			<h3 id="citylife">Life in the Big City</h3>
			<p>One's lot in life is almost entirely dependent in which level of Valastar one is born. One could live a comfortable and long life in luxury, never needing to work a day in their life, or they could die young, caught in a horrific work accident in the Furnaces. Though, despite this, there are many things a citizen in Valastar has access to that would be considered near miraculous in other settings. Indoor plumbing, running water and relatively bountiful food provides luxuries to any who can afford them. Even the most destitute can usually use public works and scrounge up the coinage needed to survive off of recycled fungal gruel.</p>

			<h5 id="currency">Currency</h5>
			<p>While the city itself does have a singular central currency, there are institutions that produce their own currencies with their own limitations, specifically many of the factories in the Furnaces and the Order Solarus. The central currency is usually accepted anywhere, though institution specific currencies may have reduced or even no value outside of its institution of origin.</p>

			<p><em>*Factory currencies are virtually worthless outside of the specific factory that it originates from. The few outsiders who do accept it (usually closely working factories or businesses) do so from one half to as little as one tenth of the currency's value. All others refuse such currency.<br>
			**The currency of Order Solarus was made to be a way for the Order to pay for public works, though as it was never backed in anything it quickly became virtually worthless. As such, it is only accepted by the deeply devout and order itself, with payments made in Order currency usually being seen as a donation instead of a transaction.</em></p>

			<h5 id="foodanddrink">Food and Drink</h5>
			<p>What you eat and drink varies wildly by where and how you live, ranging from dirty water from public pumps and the foul tasting paste known as gruel, to full on banquets with fresh fruits, vegetables and real, actual meat.

			<h5 id="services">Services</h5>
			<p>With such a large and diverse population, Valastar boasts a deeply varied list of potential professions, both legal and unsavory. As such, whatever someone needs done, there is almost certainly someone willing to do it, provided their fees are paid. These costs are only the starting point, with luxurious and riskier variants costing far more, if available at all.</p>

			<p><strong>Licenses.</strong> Not every item is legal to own and use. Restricted item licenses allow legal use of restricted items, and must be attached to an identity card. Fake idenities require a DC 10 + 2 per rank Intelligence(Investigation) check to recognize as fake, and can have a max rank of 10.</p>
			<p><strong>Medical Attention.</strong> Sometimes having access to a doctor can save a life. Medical attention can be used to treat diseases or poison, recover hit points or remove scars over time (similar to the regenerate spell). A public doctor works in a public office, with all the prying eyes and bystanders that entails. Private doctors will visit a patient's home, but must still record and report any procedures they do to public records. Finally a discrete doctor can provide medical services without any paper trail leading back to a client.</p>
			<p><strong>Verti-rail</strong> A series of track based vehicles somewhere between a trolley and elevator. This system is city wide and is the most accessible mode of transportation. Though, despite politicians' promises for citizens to be able to travel anywhere in the city for 2 pennies, identification cards, hostile "security" checkpoints and predatory ticket sellers make moving across levels far more difficult than the small fee entails.</em></p>

			<h5 id="tech">Technology</h5>
			<p>Below are tables including the wonderful technology offered widely throughout the city. Most technology in the city runs off of flux power, which comes in the form of power cells (minor, standard or major) or by plugged power, which requires a flux outlet in a wall or surface.</p>

The average thought gem can store 1 minute of video, 10 minutes of audio, an image of an object no larger than 5 feet on any side or 15,000 words. Such a gem is small enough to be held in one hand. More specialized thought gems do exist, such as those used to program constructs, store musical albums and giant databases to store criminal data. Such advanced gems vary wildly in price and size.</em></td>

			<h5 id="language">Languages</h5>
			<p>A multitude of languages can be heard on the streets and within the hidden halls of Valastar. Though there is a standardized language used across the city: common (and its slang riddled variant, undercommon), other languages are used often in homes, cultural centers and in secret meetings.

			<h3 id="levels">The Levels</h3>
			<p>Valastar is deeply stratified, with the wealthy and affluent both literally and figuratively living above the less fortunate. Each level has its own unique spread of culture, organizations and role it plays in the continuation of Valastar.</p>
			<h3 id="thespires">The Spires</h3>
			<p>Far above even the Gilded City, the Spires are a series of towers built by the richest and most influential members of Valastar's elite. Each tower is unique, with styles and materials depending on the individual who commissioned it, but gold filigree, polished marble brick and other such ostentatious displays of wealth are virtually a requirement. The towers pierce through the clouds, leaving nothing between them and the sun, with constant, comfortable sunlight covering them at all times.</p>
			<h5>Organizations</h5>
			<p>The Spires are so exclusive that it hardly has a population high enough to organize beyond their already exclusive status. That being said, there is little the aristocrats of Valastar would not do to make themselves even more exclusive.</p>
			<p><strong>The Aurum Society.</strong> A group of Valastar's most affluent and wealthy, even amongst the Spires. Formed as a political coalition to maintain their power in the face of both the Order Solarus and Gilded Council's humane efforts. The society has near absolute power over the politics of Valastar, with their only real opponent being betrayal and intrigue from their own ranks.<br>
			<strong>The Gilded Council.</strong> A council of ancient and powerful metallic dragons, headed by the gold dragon Aurithax Vaelzaryn. Deeply involved with the politics of Valastar, the council seek slow and steady progress towards a more humane and peaceful world. Though many feel their slow pace is far too slow, with generations of humanoids coming and going between each minor step they take.<br>
			<strong>The Sunlit Club.</strong> A newer organization created by Janelle Collins, a scion of the prodigious Collins family, after he was denied a seat within the Aurum Society. Made up predominantly of the few younger Spire residents, the club serves as an openly secret society. Despite the claims, it is well known that the club members discuss the blatant unfairness of Valastar society (though only in how it is unfair to themselves), and that its members spend far more time bemoaning their "lack" of status than taking any sort of action.</p>
			<h5>Neighborhoods and Landmarks</h5>
			<p>Virtually everywhere amongst the Spires is notable, with the rarest materials and most dramatic architecture on display.</p>
			<p><strong>Spire Solarus.</strong> While not the tallest, and far from the most extravagant of the towers, the Spire Solarus is the only taste of Valastar's heights that the average citizen has access to. Built and maintained by the Order Solarus as a temple and holy site, the tower serves as the destination of many devout pilgrims. The spire is topped with an open air platform, allowing the devoted to bask in the radiant light of their god. The citizens of the Spires, however, see the Spire Solarus as a route the uncouth and undeserving masses use to ruin their perfect community.</p>
			<p><strong>Aerie Eternus.</strong> The meeting place of the Gilded Council, it is a common sight to see one of the many great dragons flying through the spires to and from the Aerie Eternus. Completely unreachable from any means besides flight, very few mortals have seen within the Aerie's filigreed halls and gardens.</p>
			<p><strong>The Aethereal.</strong> A massive stage, theater and art gallery magically held aloft by enchanted clouds, the Aethereal is the most prodigious entertainment in all of Valastar. Owned and ran by the cloud giant aristocrat and philanthropist Vaeloris Galeheart, the magical stage provides new performances and exhibits nearly daily. The Aethereal never stays put, moving from place to place between each performance.</p>
			<h5>Goods and Services</h5>
			<p>While the inhabitants of the Spires have access to nearly anything the city could provide, almost all of it is produced elsewhere. There are no markets, stores or workplaces amongst the towers, with servants being tasked with the constant flow of goods from the Gilded City below to feed the needs of the aristocracy. The few towers not dedicated to the individual manors and private property of the citizenry is made up of restaurants, theaters, galleries and gardens for the entertainment of those citizens. Nothing amongst the Spires is less than aristocratic in comfort and expense.</p>
			<h5>Law and Crime</h5>
			<p>Law enforcement is rare amongst the Spires, with most residents and businesses hiring private security to protect themselves and their wealth. Violent crime is exceedingly rare, with crimes such as corruption, embezzlement and other such crimes being far more common. Regardless of the crime, most incidents are handled by the residents themselves, and are often covered up, leading many citizens to believe they are above the law. The only other crime that happens within the Spires is the rare and daring heist of some object of great value or significance, which nearly always leads to a city wide man hunt and a crackdown against all criminals (real and imagined) of the lower levels.</p>
