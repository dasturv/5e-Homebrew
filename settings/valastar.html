				Setting: Valastar
			</div>
			<p><em>Georgie gripped onto the crumbling stone railing, his stomach reeling. He looked up, through the criss-crossing bridges of the warrens and saw a faint golden light. Sunlight, he was told it was called. It seemed unnatural to him, how could some orb in the sky make light? He breathed deeply and looked down, towards the crimson light of the furnaces below. The sight of his home with its comforting flames steeled him as he got up. He looked up again. If he was going to save his sister, he better get used to this whole "open air" thing...</em></p>
			<h3>An Urban World</h3>
			<p>The world of Valastar consists of a singular, impossibly large city of the same name. Built atop its own crumbling ruins, the city of Valastar reaches far above the dark clouds below, and far above any known ground below, it's sides falling endlessly into the void. There is no wilderness, only forgotten corners of the impossibly large city. The city itself is deeply stratified, both literally and figuratively, with the lower and older levels housing the less fortunate citizens and more dangerous trades.</p>
			<p><strong>The Spires.</strong> Standing proudly above the rest of the city are a series of mighty towers, home to the truly wealthiest and most affluent members of Valastar's society. Reaching even above the artificial clouds of the Garden and Gilded City below, the eternal day is never broken for the residents of the Spires.<br>
			<strong>The Gilded City.</strong> Beautiful architecture of white stone, gold and brass makes up the Gilded City, home to wealthy citizens and politicians. The sprawling city boasts many parks and manors, and serves as the political center for all of Valastar.<br>
			<strong>The Garden.</strong> Massive platforms reach out over the void from the Garden, with vast fields of grain and produce grown using the endless sunlight and rain from artificial clouds. The Garden provides the majority of fresh food for the city, at least for those who can afford it. The citizenry of the Garden subsists of the owners of land and successful businesses, enjoying the rays of sunlight peaking through the clouds and towers above.<br>
			<strong>The Warrens.</strong> Overcrowded and bleak, the Warrens are where the vast majority of Valastar's overworked, malnourished populace live in quiet desperation. Barely any sunlight reaches the Warrens, with only those nearest the Garden seeing natural light with any regularity. The citizens living within the Warrens are most often laborers for the Garden above or the Furnaces below, sprinkled with small business owners, low ranking law enforcement and successful criminals.<br>
			<strong>The Furnaces.</strong> Metal pipes breaking through ancient architecture, the hellish red glow of fire and flux, and the constant, deafening sounds of industry define the Furnaces. The industrial heart of Valastar, the Furnaces are an incredible vast series of factories and refineries that transform the arcane substance known as flux into the raw materials required for the city to run. Violent accidents and crime are common here, with the truly destitute carving out homes in broken ruins between the factories.<br>
			<strong>The Undercity.</strong> Only the truly desperate try and make a home in the Undercity. Only lit by the faint flickering of the Furnaces above, the Undercity has virtually no laws nor structure. Criminals seeking to escape justice or vengeful rivals, people who have lost everything to debtors, and the truly destitute and discard by society call the Undercity home. Violence, death and disappearences are commonplace here, and everyone here wants out.<br>
			<strong>The Abyss.</strong> No light exists in the Abyss. Made of ancient architecture long forgotten, the city itself seems almost alive this deep. Pathways change themselves, people hear whispers and screams, horrid abominations stalk dark paths and ruins. Only the bravest or most foolhardy delve into the Abyss, and most never are seen again.</p>
			<h3>Unknown Origins</h3>
			<p>Whatever the city was, or who built it are facts long lost to the ravages of time. For as long as history records, scholars of Valastar have attempted to unravel the mysteries of the past, though every discovery made has done little but provide more questions.</p>
			<p><strong>Flux.</strong> The mysterious crimson substance know as flux, the lifeblood of Valastar, comes up from massive metal pipes that stab into the bottomless Abyss, with any attempts to find their source being met with tragedy. The great machines and templates the citizenry uses to mold flux are impossibly ancient, with the understanding behind them lost. The people of Valastar know these arcane machines work, but not how, making innovation and repairs near impossible.<br>
			<strong>A Rising Darkness.</strong> The affluent of Valastar have always attempted to build further and further into the sky, and yet, the city itself has never seemed to grow larger. The Abyss slowly but steadily eats away at the lowest levels, claiming ever more city into itself.<br>
			<strong>Endless Day.</strong> There is no day or night in Valastar. The sun sits directly overhead, above the city itself, never moving nor setting. It is only the city itself, alongside the dark roiling clouds beneath the Garden that blocks light from reaching the destitute citizens below.</p>
			<h3>Life in the Big City</h3>
			<p>One's lot in life is almost entirely dependent in which level of Valastar one is born. One could live a comfortable and long life in luxury, never needing to work a day in their life, or they could die young, caught in a horrific work accident in the Furnaces. Though, despite this, there are many things a citizen in Valastar has access to that would be considered near miraculous in other settings. Indoor plumbing, running water and relatively bountiful food provides luxuries to any who can afford them. Even the most destitute can usually use public works and scrounge up the coinage needed to survive off of recycled fungal gruel.</p>
			<h5>Currency</h5>
			<p>While the city itself does have a singular central currency, there are institutions that produce their own currencies with their own limitations, specifically many of the factories in the Furnaces and the Order Solarus. The central currency is usually accepted anywhere, though institution specific currencies may have reduced or even no value outside of its institution of origin.</p>

			<p><em>*Factory currencies are virtually worthless outside of the specific factory who created it. The few outsiders who do accept it (usually closely working factories or businesses) do so from one half to as little as one tenth of the currency's value. All others refuse such currency<br>
			**Order Solarus currency was a scheme to mint a new coinage to pay for public works. As such, it is only accepted by the deeply devout and order itself, with payments in Order currency usually being seen as a donation instead of a transaction.</em></p>
