			<p><em>Georgie gripped onto the crumbling stone railing, his stomach reeling. He looked up, through the criss-crossing bridges of the warrens and saw a faint golden light. Sunlight, he was told it was called. It seemed unnatural to him, how could some orb in the sky make light? He breathed deeply and looked down, towards the crimson light of the furnaces below. The sight of his home with its comforting flames steeled him as he got up. He looked up again. If he was going to save his sister, he better get used to this whole "open air" thing...</em></p>

			<h3 id="overview">An Urban World</h3>
			<p>The world of Valastar consists of a singular, impossibly large city of the same name. Built atop its own crumbling ruins, the city of Valastar reaches far above the dark clouds below, and far above any known ground below, it's sides falling endlessly into the void. There is no wilderness, only forgotten corners of the impossibly large city. The city itself is deeply stratified, both literally and figuratively, with the lower and older levels housing the less fortunate citizens and more dangerous trades.</p>
			<p><strong>The Spires.</strong> Standing proudly above the rest of the city are a series of mighty towers, home to the truly wealthiest and most affluent members of Valastar's society. Reaching even above the artificial clouds of the Garden and Gilded City below, the eternal day is never broken for the residents of the Spires.<br>
			<strong>The Gilded City.</strong> Beautiful architecture of white stone, gold and brass makes up the Gilded City, home to wealthy citizens and politicians. The sprawling city boasts many parks and manors, and serves as the political center for all of Valastar.<br>
			<strong>The Garden.</strong> Massive platforms reach out over the void from the Garden, with vast fields of grain and produce grown using the endless sunlight and rain from artificial clouds. The Garden provides the majority of fresh food for the city, at least for those who can afford it. The citizenry of the Garden subsists of the owners of land and successful businesses, enjoying the rays of sunlight peeking through the clouds and towers above.<br>
			<strong>The Warrens.</strong> Overcrowded and bleak, the Warrens are where the vast majority of Valastar's overworked, malnourished populace live in quiet desperation. Barely any sunlight reaches the Warrens, with only those nearest the Garden seeing natural light with any regularity. The citizens living within the Warrens are most often laborers for the Garden above or the Furnaces below, sprinkled with small business owners, low ranking law enforcement and successful criminals.<br>
			<strong>The Furnaces.</strong> Metal pipes breaking through ancient architecture, the hellish red glow of fire and flux, and the constant, deafening sounds of industry define the Furnaces. The industrial heart of Valastar, the Furnaces are an incredible vast series of factories and refineries that transform the arcane substance known as flux into the raw materials required for the city to run. Violent accidents and crime are common here, with the truly destitute carving out homes in broken ruins between the factories.<br>
			<strong>The Undercity.</strong> Only the truly desperate try and make a home in the Undercity. Only lit by the faint flickering of the Furnaces above, the Undercity has virtually no laws nor structure. Criminals seeking to escape justice or vengeful rivals, people who have lost everything to debtors, and the truly destitute and discard by society call the Undercity home. Violence, death and disappearences are commonplace here, and everyone here wants out.<br>
			<strong>The Abyss.</strong> No light exists in the Abyss. Made of ancient architecture long forgotten, the city itself seems almost alive this deep. Pathways change themselves, people hear whispers and screams, horrid abominations stalk dark paths and ruins. Only the bravest or most foolhardy delve into the Abyss, and most never are seen again.</p>
			
			<h3>Unknown Origins</h3>
			<p>Whatever the city was, or who built it are facts long lost to the ravages of time. For as long as history records, scholars of Valastar have attempted to unravel the mysteries of the past, though every discovery made has done little but provide more questions.</p>
			<p><strong>Flux.</strong> The mysterious crimson substance know as flux, the lifeblood of Valastar, comes up from massive metal pipes that stab into the bottomless Abyss, with any attempts to find their source being met with tragedy. The great machines and templates the citizenry uses to mold flux are impossibly ancient, with the understanding behind them lost. The people of Valastar know these arcane machines work, but not how, making innovation and repairs near impossible.<br>
			<strong>A Rising Darkness.</strong> The affluent of Valastar have always attempted to build further and further into the sky, and yet, the city itself has never seemed to grow larger. The Abyss slowly but steadily eats away at the lowest levels, claiming ever more city into itself.<br>
			<strong>Endless Day.</strong> There is no day or night in Valastar. The sun sits directly overhead, above the city itself, never moving nor setting. It is only the city itself, alongside the dark roiling clouds beneath the Garden that blocks light from reaching the destitute citizens below.</p>

			<h3>Laws and Governance</h3>
			<p>The government of Valastar is found within the Gilded City, and is made up of three branches.</p>
			<p><strong>The Consiet.</strong> The largest and most powerful branch of Valastar's governance, the Consiet is a body of elected officials. Granted the authority to create and change laws, the members of the Consiet (known as counts) are meant to represent a precinct or district within the city, though most live and come from the upper levels.</p>
			<p><strong>The Tribunes.</strong> A pair of individuals elected by the city as a whole, the Tribunes have the authority to enforce laws and veto laws created by the Consiet. The positions are claimed to be there to protect the needs of the populace, though over the centuries it has been made to be a mere status symbol for powerful nobles. The pair of Tribunes oversee the policing of the entire City</p>
			<p><strong>The Courts.</strong> Seperate from the other branches, the courts serve as the arbiter of the law, deciding upon legal and civil cases. The High Court, found within the Gilded City, spends time checking centuries of precedent and tradition in order to decide if new laws or actions are considered legal.</p>
			<p>Generally speaking, the lower in the city you go, the less prevalent and more corrupt the rule of law is. In the upper levels it is a respected and trusted institution, whereas in the lower levels it is often used and abused by factory owners and crime lords to keep the populace under control and productive.</p>
			
			<h3 id="citylife">Life in the Big City</h3>
			<p>One's lot in life is almost entirely dependent in which level of Valastar one is born. One could live a comfortable and long life in luxury, never needing to work a day in their life, or they could die young, caught in a horrific work accident in the Furnaces. Though, despite this, there are many things a citizen in Valastar has access to that would be considered near miraculous in other settings. Indoor plumbing, running water and relatively bountiful food provides luxuries to any who can afford them. Even the most destitute can usually use public works and scrounge up the coinage needed to survive off of recycled fungal gruel.</p>

			<h5 id="goods-and-services">Goods and Services</h5>
			<p>Valastar has many things in common with standard DnD worlds, but also many, many differences. Ranging from strange arcanotech to mechanical augmentations, you can find all the strange and powerful purchasing options of Valastar <a href="valastar/goods_and_services.html">here</a>.

			<h5 id="language">Languages</h5>
			<p>A multitude of languages can be heard on the streets and within the hidden halls of Valastar. Though there is a standardized language used across the city: common (and its slang riddled variant, undercommon), other languages are used often in homes, cultural centers and in secret meetings. Upon character creation, a player selects common or undercommon instead of their standard languages granted to them by their lineage.</p>

			<h3 id="levels">The Levels</h3>
			<p>Valastar is deeply stratified, with the wealthy and affluent both literally and figuratively living above the less fortunate. Each level has its own unique spread of culture, organizations and role it plays in the continuation of Valastar.</p>
			

			<h3 id="thespires">The Spires</h3>
			<p>Far above even the Gilded City, the Spires are a series of towers built by the richest and most influential members of Valastar's elite. Each tower is unique, with styles and materials depending on the individual who commissioned it, but gold filigree, polished marble brick and other such ostentatious displays of wealth are virtually a requirement. The towers pierce through the clouds, leaving nothing between them and the sun, with constant, comfortable sunlight covering them at all times.</p>
			
			<h5>Organizations</h5>
			<p>The Spires are so exclusive that it hardly has a population high enough to organize beyond their already exclusive status. That being said, there is little the aristocrats of Valastar would not do to make themselves even more exclusive.</p>
			<p><strong>The Aurum Society.</strong> A group of Valastar's most affluent and wealthy, even amongst the Spires. Formed as a political coalition to maintain their power in the face of both the Order Solarus and Gilded Council's humane efforts. The society has near absolute power over the politics of Valastar, with their only real opponent being betrayal and intrigue from their own ranks.<br>
			<strong>The Gilded Council.</strong> A council of ancient and powerful metallic dragons, headed by the gold dragon Auri Vaelzyn. Deeply involved with the politics of Valastar, the council seek slow and steady progress towards a more humane and peaceful world. Though many feel their slow pace is far too slow, with generations of humanoids coming and going between each minor step they take.<br>
			<strong>The Sunlit Club.</strong> A newer organization created by Janelle Collins, a scion of the prodigious Collins family, after he was denied a seat within the Aurum Society. Made up predominantly of the few younger Spire residents, the club serves as an openly secret society. Despite the claims, it is well known that the club members discuss the blatant unfairness of Valastar society (though only in how it is unfair to themselves), and that its members spend far more time bemoaning their "lack" of status than taking any sort of action.</p>
			
			<h5>Neighborhoods and Landmarks</h5>
			<p>Virtually everywhere amongst the Spires is notable, with the rarest materials and most dramatic architecture on display.</p>
			<p><strong>Spire Solarus.</strong> While not the tallest, and far from the most extravagant of the towers, the Spire Solarus is the only taste of Valastar's heights that the average citizen has access to. Built and maintained by the Order Solarus as a temple and holy site, the tower serves as the destination of many devout pilgrims. The spire is topped with an open air platform, allowing the devoted to bask in the radiant light of their god. The citizens of the Spires, however, see the Spire Solarus as a route the uncouth and undeserving masses use to ruin their perfect community.</p>
			<p><strong>Aerie Eternus.</strong> The meeting place of the Gilded Council, it is a common sight to see one of the many great dragons flying through the spires to and from the Aerie Eternus. Completely unreachable from any means besides flight, very few mortals have seen within the Aerie's filigreed halls and gardens.</p>
			<p><strong>The Aethereal.</strong> A massive stage, theater and art gallery magically held aloft by enchanted clouds, the Aethereal is the most prodigious entertainment in all of Valastar. Owned and ran by the cloud giant aristocrat and philanthropist Vaeloris Galeheart, the magical stage provides new performances and exhibits nearly daily. The Aethereal never stays put, moving from place to place between each performance.</p>
			<p><strong>The Skyway.</strong> A complex series of wildspaces, the Skyways are long stretches and large regions of open air that are legally protected and cannot be built into. While originally made for the sake of the spire's draconic residents, the Skyways also serve as the primary habitat for Valastar's remaining avian populations. Within the spires there are several parks and structure made specifically to support these animals, sponsored by the lifeshaper's guild.</p>
			
			<h5>Goods and Services</h5>
			<p>While the inhabitants of the Spires have access to nearly anything the city could provide, almost all of it is produced elsewhere. There are no markets, stores or workplaces amongst the towers, with servants being tasked with the constant flow of goods from the Gilded City below to feed the needs of the aristocracy. The few towers not dedicated to the individual manors and private property of the citizenry is made up of restaurants, theaters, galleries and gardens for the entertainment of those citizens. Nothing amongst the Spires is less than aristocratic in comfort and expense.</p>
			
			<h5>Law and Crime</h5>
			<p>Law enforcement is rare amongst the Spires, with most residents and businesses hiring private security to protect themselves and their wealth. Violent crime is exceedingly rare, with crimes such as corruption, embezzlement and other such crimes being far more common. Regardless of the crime, most incidents are handled by the residents themselves, and are often covered up, leading many citizens to believe they are above the law. The only other crime that happens within the Spires is the rare and daring heist of some object of great value or significance, which nearly always leads to a city wide man hunt and a crackdown against all criminals (real and imagined) of the lower levels.</p>
			<p>With private security crawling all over the spires, guards can respond in as little as 2d10 rounds, and are usually far better equipped than standard guards. A typical patrol is made up of 5 (2d4) Veterans.</p>

			<h3 id="gildedcity">The Gilded City</h3>
			<p>Coated in gold and brass, the Gilded City is the political, spiritual and economic heart of Valastar. Housing the city's government, stock exchange and the high church of the Order Solarus, virtually every important decision and decree is made within the Gilded City. The level itself is a bustling hub of activity, with constant daylight illuminating the dynamic citizenry of the city.</p>
			
			<h5>Organizations</h5>
			<p>The Gilded City is filled to bursting with organizations, guilds and clubs, ranging from political groups, religious orders and trade networks.</p>
			<p><strong>Guild Primus</strong> A council of guild leaders from around the city, the Guild Primus use their prodigious wealth to influence the politics of Valastar in order to maintain high profits for themselves.<br>
			<strong>The Order Solarus.</strong> The church of Valastar, the order worships Sola, the goddess of the sun. The order brings in great wealth through the donations and charity of its devoted, and though it tries to improve the lives of the citizenry, its naive approach and ineffiencies stymie its progress.<br>
			<strong>The Fluxfires.</strong> A secret society of rebels, anarchists and terrorists, the Fluxfires are a group beloved by the downtrodden and feared by the powerful. Their ring leaders have never been caught, with wild theories indicating they may be led by someone of prodigious wealth and intellect. Targeting politicians, businesses and infrastructure, the Fluxfires are uncanny in their strikes.</p>

			<h5>Neighborhoods and Landmarks</h5>
			<p>The Gilded City is a place of grand aspirations and deep history.</p>
			<p><strong>The Triarch Hall.</strong> The political heart of Valastar, housing the Consiet, Tribunal Offices and High Court, this grand three winged building sits in the center of a vast green field. The surroundings are filled by smaller buildings and businesses, all constructed to aid, feed and entertain the politicians. </p>
			<p><strong>Lake Crystalline</strong> A massive, crystal clear lake found in the center of the Gilded City. The lake was formed when a cloud-making arcanomachine malfunctioned and began to flood nearby neighborhoods. The city quickly erected a series of robust walls and dams to keep the water contained, forming the beautiful lake. Despite not being intentional, the lake now serves as an important resevoir of water for the fields of the Garden layer below, especially useful when other arcanomachines need repaired or replaced. Deep within the lake the ancient arcanomachine still pumps out water, with divers occasionally needing to brave the flooded city streets below the surface to check on the mechanism.</p>
			<p><strong>The Grand Exchange</strong> the largest market, stock exchange and banking location in all of Valastar, the Grand Exchange is a business center larger than some precints. Whereas legal power flows through the Triarch Hall, wealth flows through the Grand Exchange.</p>
			
			<h5>Goods and Services</h5>
			<p>Citizens of the Gilded City have access to all but the most esoteric of goods and services, with ample access to food, entertainment and any other needs. Resturaunts, theaters, museums, shops, fresh produce markets, public parks and all other forms of purchasable comforts are widely available. Most goods and service in the Gilded City are of comfortable quality or higher.</p>
			
			<h5>Law and Crime</h5>
			<p>The Gilded City is incredibly safe from violent and even most petty crimes. With law enforcement in Valastar predominantly centering around the Tribunes, the rule of law is well respected and dutifully enforced. Scandals of embezzlement and corruption are more common, but are usually met with legal action and a firm belief that the law will punish wrongdoers appropriately. On the opposite end, criminals are shunned at best and exiled at worst, with a common belief being criminality is a blight on a neighborhood that must be remove lest it spread.</p>
			<p>With plaw enforcement being near omnipresent, guards can respond in 4d10 rounds. A typical patrol is made up of 5 (2d4) <a href="../monsters/monster_list/soldier.html">Soldiers</a> and 1 Veteran.</p>
