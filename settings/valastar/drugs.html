			<p>In a world where so many seek an escape, either from horrible living conditions or intense boredom in a cushioned life, drugs are all too common. Ranging from benign party drugs to life threatening combat stims, drugs in valastar serve a very similar purpose as potions in other worlds, though with far more dangerous side effects.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Obtaining Drugs</strong><br>
			Drugs are spread across the entire breadth of legality, cost and rarity. The more illegal and more rare a drug, the harder it is to find and purchase. Legal drugs can be found in general stores, pharmacies and factory canteens throughout the city. Restricted drugs are more specialized, being sold by doctors and pharmacists and often require some form of prescription or registration to purchase and sell. Illegal drugs are only sold on black markets and through criminal contacts, and even being caught holding onto them can put you behind bars.</p>
			<p><em>For example, lets say our poor little wiz-ganger Georgie was heading to a fight with a big and scary ogre, and decided he needed himself a boost. He tracked down his friend who sold pixie dust, an illegal but powerful magical drug. Expensive stuff, but after some haggling he managed to get some for the low price of fifty gelt and a future favor...</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Doing Drugs</strong><br>
			In order to gain the benefits of a drug, you need to introduce it to your system. Each drug has one or more Vectors, or methods to use it. These vectors can be contact, ingestion, inhalation, or injection. Each vector also has an Acting Time, or amount of time must pass after the vector method is used before the effects of the drug starts. After the acting time, a drug grants its effects. Finally, once the effects of the drug wears off, the user must make an addiction saving throw, as detailed below.</p>
			<p><em>Georgie made sure to pack his pixie dust before heading out, dipping into an alleyway to inhale a pinch before stepping foot into his foe's territory. Being new to the stuff, he sneezes loudly, blowing iridescent powder everywhere. He thinks he did it right though, so he makes his way down the street. After a minute he sees his opponent, shoving some poor worker around, right as the drug's arcane power begins to course through him. He grins, this was gonna be easy...</em></p>
			
			<p><strong>Addiction</strong><br>
			Once a drug's effects have worn off, a user must make a saving throw to prevent addiction, with the specific saving throw based on the drugs addictiveness and addiction save. The DC of this saving throw increases by 1 for each time the user had used the drug in the drug's addiction interval. If a user fails this saving throw, the become addicted to the drug. Whenever an addicted creature completes a long rest without using the addicted drug in the past 24 hours, the suffer the drug's withdrawal symptoms until the use the drug again.</p>
			<p><em>The scrap goes well, and Georgie feels pretty good, maybe even too good. As his high fades and the magical effects of the drugs wears off, he needs to resist getting addicted. He had never done pixie dust before, much less previously this month, so the save DC for the drug is its base of 20 and targets Georgie's Wisdom. All said and done, Georgie has a +4 to Wisdom saves, and after rolling a respectable 15 on his save he has a total of 19! Just barely missing the DC, he becomes addicted. He slips back home, thinking how useful pixie dust is...</em></p>

			<p><strong>Escaping Addiction</strong><br>
			Once a creature is addicted to a drug, it can be difficult escape that cycle. An creature addicted to a drug can repeat the addiction saving throw once each time the addicted drug's interval elapses. The DC of this saving still increases by 1 for each time the creature had used the drug during that interval.</p>
			<p><em>Pixie dust was tearing Georgie's life apart. The expenses, the exhaustion, and worst of all the pain caused by spellcasting. His friends had an intervention over two months ago, and he was trying really hard to get clean. He wasn't perfect, he did use pixie dust three times last month, but he was doing better. At the end of the month he makes another saving throw against the addiction. This time the DC is 23 (+1 for each time he used pixie dust over the past month). With his friends help though, and some more experience under his belt, Georgie has advantage on the saving throw and has a +6 bonus this time. After rolling a 19, for a total of 25, he is finally able to put his addiction behind him...</em></p>

			<p><strong>Mixing Drugs</strong><br>
			Having many drugs in your system at one time is a recipe for disaster. Whenever you use a drug while under the effects of another (or within one hour of using a drug with an instant effect), you must make a constitution saving throw. The DC for this saving throw is equal to the highest base addiction save DC amongst the mixed drugs, plus 2 for each other drug mixed. On a failure you gain one level of exhaustion. Taking multiple of the same drug still counts mixing drugs.</p>
