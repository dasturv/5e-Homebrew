			<p>The following tables are a collection of items, goods and services purchasable in Valastar.</p>

			<h5 id="foodanddrink">Food and Drink</h5>
			<p>What you eat and drink varies wildly by where and how you live, ranging from dirty water from public pumps and the foul tasting paste known as gruel, to full on banquets with fresh fruits, vegetables and real, actual meat. Below is a list of food and drink items with their associated prices. These prices are simply base prices, and can vary dramatically based on availability and quality.</p>

			<h5 id="services">Services</h5>
			<p>With such a large and diverse population, Valastar boasts a deeply varied list of potential professions, both legal and unsavory. As such, whatever someone needs done, there is almost certainly someone willing to do it, provided their fees are paid. These costs are only the starting point, with luxurious and riskier variants costing far more, if available at all.</p>

			<p><strong>Licenses.</strong> Not every item is legal to own and use. Restricted item licenses allow legal use of restricted items, and must be attached to an identity card. Fake idenities require a DC 10 + 2 per rank Intelligence(Investigation) check to recognize as fake, and can have a max rank of 10.</p>
			<p><strong>Medical Attention.</strong> Sometimes having access to a doctor can save a life. Medical attention can be used to treat diseases or poison, recover hit points or remove scars over time (similar to the regenerate spell). A public doctor works in a public office, with all the prying eyes and bystanders that entails. Private doctors will visit a patient's home, but must still record and report any procedures they do to public records. Finally a discrete doctor can provide medical services without any paper trail leading back to a client.</p>

			<h5 id="transportation">Transportation</h5>
			<p>Despite its urban nature, travelling through Valastar can be just as difficult as any wilderness. In a world where wealth is king and divisions run deep, the places you can travel is nearly always directly proportional to the amount of coinage you can provide for the privelage.</p>
			<p><strong>Carts and Carriages.</strong> When things need to be moved away from the verti-rail lines, the most common vehicle is the humble cart. Small, robust and either manually pulled or mechanized, carts are commonly seen hauling products and people. Carriages, on the other hand are usually reserved for the wealthy as a private means to get from their private verti-rail car to their estates. Having animals pulling a cart or carriage is very rare, and is seen as a novelty for aristocrats rather than an level of efficient.</p>
			<p><strong>The Ratways.</strong> The Ratways are not any official or maintained method of travel, instead being a complex series of forgotten alleys, abandoned tunnels and defunct flux pipes that can be used to travel within the city without being seen. The Ratway is a dangerous way to travel for those unaware of its secrets, with wild beasts, collapsing tunnels and traps waiting for anyone who strays from the proper paths. It requires a DC 20 Intelligence(Investigation) check to find a new entrance to the Ratways, and a DC 20 Wisdom(Survival) check to navigate them. A character who knows thieves cant has advantage on these checks. Travelling through the Ratways takes 50% longer, but there is no risk of being seen while travelling.</p>
			<p><strong>Sky Barges.</strong> Usually restricted to the wealthiest of denizens, sky barges are flying ships enchanted with magic that keep them afloat. It is rare to see one below the Spires, and even more so beneath the clouds.</p>
			<p><strong>Verti-rail.</strong> A series of track based vehicles somewhere between a trolley and elevator. This system is city wide and is the most accessible mode of transportation. Though, despite politicians' promises for citizens to be able to travel anywhere in the city for 2 pennies, identification cards, hostile "security" checkpoints and predatory ticket sellers make moving across levels far more difficult than the small fee entails.</p>
