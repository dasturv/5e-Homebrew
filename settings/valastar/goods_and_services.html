			<p>The following tables are a collection of items, goods and services purchasable in Valastar.</p>

			<h5 id="currency">Currency</h5>
			<p>While the city itself does have a singular central currency, there are institutions that produce their own currencies with their own limitations, specifically many of the factories in the Furnaces and the Order Solarus. The central currency is usually accepted anywhere, though institution specific currencies may have reduced or even no value outside of its institution of origin.</p>

			<p><em>*Factory currencies are virtually worthless outside of the specific factory that it originates from. The few outsiders who do accept it (usually closely working factories or businesses) do so from one half to as little as one tenth of the currency's value. All others refuse such currency.<br>
			**The currency of Order Solarus was made to be a way for the Order to pay for public works, though as it was never backed in anything it quickly became virtually worthless. As such, it is only accepted by the deeply devout and order itself, with payments made in Order currency usually being seen as a donation instead of a transaction.</em></p>

			<h5 id="foodanddrink">Food and Drink</h5>
			<p>What you eat and drink varies wildly by where and how you live, ranging from dirty water from public pumps and the foul tasting paste known as gruel, to full on banquets with fresh fruits, vegetables and real, actual meat. Below is a list of food and drink items with their associated prices. These prices are simply base prices, and can vary dramatically based on availability and quality.</p>

			<h5 id="services">Services</h5>
			<p>With such a large and diverse population, Valastar boasts a deeply varied list of potential professions, both legal and unsavory. As such, whatever someone needs done, there is almost certainly someone willing to do it, provided their fees are paid. These costs are only the starting point, with luxurious and riskier variants costing far more, if available at all.</p>

			<p><strong>Licenses.</strong> Not every item is legal to own and use. Restricted item licenses allow legal use of restricted items, and must be attached to an identity card. Fake idenities require a DC 10 + 2 per rank Intelligence(Investigation) check to recognize as fake, and can have a max rank of 10.</p>
			<p><strong>Medical Attention.</strong> Sometimes having access to a doctor can save a life. Medical attention can be used to treat diseases or poison, recover hit points or remove scars over time (similar to the regenerate spell). A public doctor works in a public office, with all the prying eyes and bystanders that entails. Private doctors will visit a patient's home, but must still record and report any procedures they do to public records. Finally a discrete doctor can provide medical services without any paper trail leading back to a client.</p>

			<h5 id="transportation">Transportation</h5>
			<p>Despite its urban nature, travelling through Valastar can be just as difficult as any wilderness. In a world where wealth is king and divisions run deep, the places you can travel is nearly always directly proportional to the amount of coinage you can provide for the privelage.</p>
			<p><strong>Carts and Carriages.</strong> When things need to be moved away from the verti-rail lines, the most common vehicle is the humble cart. Small, robust and either manually pulled or mechanized, carts are commonly seen hauling products and people. Carriages, on the other hand are usually reserved for the wealthy as a private means to get from their private verti-rail car to their estates. Having animals pulling a cart or carriage is very rare, and is seen as a novelty for aristocrats rather than an level of efficient.</p>
			<p><strong>The Ratways.</strong> The Ratways are not any official or maintained method of travel, instead being a complex series of forgotten alleys, abandoned tunnels and defunct flux pipes that can be used to travel within the city without being seen. The Ratway is a dangerous way to travel for those unaware of its secrets, with wild beasts, collapsing tunnels and traps waiting for anyone who strays from the proper paths. It requires a DC 20 Intelligence(Investigation) check to find a new entrance to the Ratways, and a DC 20 Wisdom(Survival) check to navigate them. A character who knows thieves cant has advantage on these checks. Travelling through the Ratways takes 50% longer, but there is no risk of being seen while travelling.</p>
			<p><strong>Sky Barges.</strong> Usually restricted to the wealthiest of denizens, sky barges are flying ships enchanted with magic that keep them afloat. It is rare to see one below the Spires, and even more so beneath the clouds.</p>
			<p><strong>Verti-rail.</strong> A series of track based vehicles somewhere between a trolley and elevator. This system is city wide and is the most accessible mode of transportation. Though, despite politicians' promises for citizens to be able to travel anywhere in the city for 2 pennies, identification cards, hostile "security" checkpoints and predatory ticket sellers make moving across levels far more difficult than the small fee entails.</p>

			<h5 id="tech">Technology</h5>
			<p>Below are tables including the wonderful technology offered widely throughout the city. Most technology in the city runs off of flux power, which comes in the form of power cells (minor, standard or major) or by plugged power, which requires a flux outlet in a wall or surface.</p>
			<table class="content-table">

						<th colspan="3">Valastar Technology</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Item</th>
						<th>Cost</th>
						<th>Description</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Data Slate</td>
						<td>10 gp</td>
						<td><em>A hand-held arcane machine that can display text data from a thought gem, with a lesser ability to encode text onto the gem as well. A data slate is small enough to be held in one hand, but requires two to be used and held comfortably. A data slate can be active for 8 hours on a single minor flux cell.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Flux-lamp</td>
						<td>5 gp</td>
						<td><em>An arcane machine that uses minor flux cells to produce light. It casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. You can use a bonus action to turn on or off the light. The Flux-lamp can produce light for 48 hours on one minor flux cell.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Flux-light</td>
						<td>10 gp</td>
						<td><em>An arcane machine that uses minor flux cells to produce concentrated light. It casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. You can use a bonus action to turn on or off the light. The Flux-light can produce light for 48 hours on one minor flux cell.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Gem Seer</td>
						<td>50 gp</td>
						<td><em>A large arcane machine used to turn video or image data from a thought gem into an illusionary copy. The image or video tends to be choppy and low resolution, lacking color and prone to corruption. Higher resolution gem seers and those with color do exist, but tend to be bulky and incredibly expensive. Gem seers require direct connection to the flux grid.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Igniter</td>
						<td>1 gp</td>
						<td><em>A tiny arcane machine that uses minor flux cells to produce a small jet of flame. As an action you can ignite a fuel source, such as oil soaked rags or a barrel of spirits. Other fuels such as wood may take longer to ignite. An igniter can produce flames for 4 hours on a single minor flux cell.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Inscriber</td>
						<td>25 gp</td>
						<td><em>An inscriber is an arcane machine that can encode data into thought gems. Most inscribers are large, bulky and specialized, requiring direct plug in to the flux grid and specialized training in order to use properly. Text inscribers can be as small as a briefcase, and can be powered by flux cells.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Thought Gem</td>
						<td>1 gp</td>
						<td><em>A thought gem is a crystalline arcane mechanism designed to store data. The average thought gem can store 1 minute of video, 10 minutes of audio, an image of an object no larger than 5 feet on any side or 15,000 words. Such a gem is small enough to be held in one hand. More specialized thought gems do exist, such as those used to program constructs, store musical albums and giant databases to store criminal data. Such advanced gems vary wildly in price and size.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Voice Box</td>
						<td>25 gp</td>
						<td><em>A bulky arcane machine that turns audio data from a thought gem into sound. Requiring direct connection to the flux grid, the voice box produces clear, if slightly off pitched, audio.</em></td>
					</tr>
