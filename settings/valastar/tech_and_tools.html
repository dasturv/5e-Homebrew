			<p>Below are a series of tables showing the technology and tools available in Valastar</p>

			<h5 id="tech">Technology</h5>
			<p>Below are tables including the wonderful technology offered widely throughout the city. Most technology in the city runs off of flux power, which comes in the form of power cells (minor, standard or major) or by plugged power, which requires a flux outlet in a wall or surface. Many pieces of technology can be interfaced more directly using augments, providing special bonuses.</p>

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Item</th>
						<th>Cost</th>
						<th>Description</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Calculator</td>
						<td>5 gp</td>
						<td><em>A hand-held arcane machine that can solve complex mathematical equations quickly and accurately. A calculator is small enough to be held in one hand and can fit in a large pocket. A calculator can solve 500 equations on a single minor flux cell. <strong>While Integrated:</strong> You can enter and solve math equations through the calculator without needing to use an action.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Cogni-lock</td>
						<td>50 gp</td>
						<td><em>A small arcane machine that can recognize authorized individuals and can lock anything a lock could. A cogni-lock is usually mounted on a wall by a door or on a container. Depending on the variety, it may require a voice, face, eye or password identification. A creature proficient with slicer's tools, thieve's tools, technology or other relevant proficiency can trick, disable or bypass the cogni-lock with a DC 15 check. Some cogni-locks may have higher DCs. <strong>While Integrated:</strong> The cogni-lock will recognize you instantly (potentially setting off alarms based on what sort of system it is connected to), but you have advantage on checks to disable or bypass the cogni-lock.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Data Slate</td>
						<td>10 gp</td>
						<td><em>A hand-held arcane machine that can display text data from a thought gem, with a lesser ability to encode text onto the gem as well. A data slate is small enough to be held in one hand, but requires two to be used and held comfortably. A data slate can be active for 8 hours on a single minor flux cell. <strong>While Integrated:</strong> You can both read and write data from the data slate at twice the rate.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Flux-lamp</td>
						<td>5 gp</td>
						<td><em>An arcane machine that uses minor flux cells to produce light. It casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. You can use a bonus action to turn on or off the light. The Flux-lamp can produce light for 48 hours on one minor flux cell. <strong>While Integrated:</strong> You can turn on or off the light at will, no action required.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Flux-light</td>
						<td>10 gp</td>
						<td><em>An arcane machine that uses minor flux cells to produce concentrated light. It casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. You can use a bonus action to turn on or off the light. The Flux-light can produce light for 48 hours on one minor flux cell. <strong>While Integrated:</strong> You can turn on or off the light at will, no action required.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Flux-quill</td>
						<td>15 gp</td>
						<td><em>A hand-held arcane machine that can produces a continuous stream of ink. A flux-quill is the size of a large pen. You can use an action to change the color of the ink the flux-quill produces. A Flux-quill can produce 1 oz of ink on a single minor flux cell. <strong>While Integrated:</strong> You can write, draw or paint at twice the rate.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Gem Seer</td>
						<td>50 gp</td>
						<td><em>A large arcane machine used to turn video or image data from a thought gem into an illusionary copy. The image or video tends to be choppy and low resolution, lacking color and prone to corruption. Higher resolution gem seers and those with color do exist, but tend to be bulky and incredibly expensive. Gem seers require direct connection to the flux grid. <strong>While Integrated:</strong> You can choose to have the video or image appear within your mind, allowing only you to see it.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Igniter</td>
						<td>1 gp</td>
						<td><em>A tiny arcane machine that uses minor flux cells to produce a small jet of flame. As an action you can ignite a fuel source, such as oil soaked rags or a barrel of spirits. Other fuels such as wood may take longer to ignite. An igniter can produce flames for 4 hours on a single minor flux cell. <strong>While Integrated:</strong> You can turn on or off the flame at will, no action required.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Inscriber</td>
						<td>25 gp</td>
						<td><em>An inscriber is an arcane machine that can encode data into thought gems. Most inscribers are large, bulky and specialized, requiring direct plug in to the flux grid and specialized training in order to use properly. Text inscribers can be as small as a briefcase, and can be powered by flux cells. <strong>While Integrated:</strong> You can write data to the thought gem at three times the rate.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Scorch-drill</td>
						<td>25 gp</td>
						<td><em>A small arcane machine that is designed to burn holes through solid surfaces. As a complex action you can mount the scorch-drill onto a solid surface, using adhesives and screws to hold itself in place. As another action you can insert a standard flux cell and activate the machine. Once per round (initiative count 20) the scorch drill deals 2d6 fire damage to the surface it is mounted on. this damage occurs even undwerwater. The scorch drill can be removed from its surface as an action. The machine deals damage for 1 minute, and is destroyed in the process.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Screamer</td>
						<td>5 gp</td>
						<td><em>A tiny arcane machine that can be set to make a loud alarm sound when disturbed. A screamer is small enough to fit in one's palm. A screamer can remain active (and screaming) for 1 hour on a single minor flux cell.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Thought Gem</td>
						<td>1 gp</td>
						<td><em>A thought gem is a crystalline arcane mechanism designed to store data. The average thought gem can store 1 minute of video, 10 minutes of audio, an image of an object no larger than 5 feet on any side or 15,000 words. Such a gem is small enough to be held in one hand. More specialized thought gems do exist, such as those used to program constructs, store musical albums and giant databases to store criminal data. Such advanced gems vary wildly in price and size.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Timekeeper</td>
						<td>5 gp</td>
						<td><em>A hand-held arcane machine that keeps track of the time. A timekeeper is small enough to be held in one hand and can fit in a pocket. A timekeeper can remain active for a month on a single minor flux cell. <strong>While Integrated:</strong> You always know the time displayed on the timekeeper, even without looking.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Voice Box</td>
						<td>25 gp</td>
						<td><em>A bulky arcane machine that turns audio data from a thought gem into sound. Requiring direct connection to the flux grid, the voice box produces clear, if slightly off pitched, audio. <strong>While Integrated:</strong> You can choose to have the sound play within your mind, allowing only you to hear it.</em></td>
