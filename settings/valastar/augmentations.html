			<p>Life in Valastar is often brutal and dangerous, with industrial accidents and gang warfare leading to many injuries throughout the city. Fortunately, the progress of medical sciences and magical craft has made prosthetic limbs, eyes and even organs available to those fortunate enough to be able to afford them, or at least useful enough to a factory that they are deemed worthy of getting a replacement. Despite strict legal codes, some unscrupulous factories actually require mandatory augments in their workers, both to boost productivity and cement their control over organic workers.</p>
			<p><strong>Installing Augments</strong><br>
			Augments can be quite difficult to install properly, at least without severely injuring or even killing the recipient. Successfully installing an augment requires a successful Intelligence (Medicine) or Intelligence (Surgeon's Tools) Extended check with a 1 hour interval. The check DC depends on the specific Augment, as shown in the table below. At the end of the check, the recipient gains a level of exhaustion for each 1 hour the procedure took and gains a long term injury. These levels of exhaustion and injury can be treated and removed as normal.</p>
			<p><strong>Augment Upgrades</strong><br>
			Many augments can be further customized beyond their stock forms. Each augment can have a number of upgrades equal to its capacity, and contain a number of default upgrades (default upgrades cannot be removed and do not count against an augment's capacity).</p>
			<p><strong>Neural Load</strong><br>
			Using augments can put strain on the minds of people who use them, as the brain struggles to coordinate with an artificial extension of itself. Each augment increases a character's neural load by an amount depending on its type, as shown on the table below. Each character can have a maximum neural load equal to 2 plus either their Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest, with a minimum of 1). Attempting to install an augment when you are already at your limit deals 4d10 psychic damage to the recipient and the installation automatically fails.</p>

			<p><strong>Augments and Magic</strong><br>
			Augmenting one's body makes many forms of spellcasting far more difficult, as they interfere with the natural flow of magic through the body. As long as a spellcaster or monk has at least one augment, the gain a penalty to their spell and ki attack bonus and save DCs. The penalty is equal to one half their current neural load (rounded up). Additionally, an augmented creature who recieves magically healing, such as by the <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:cure-wounds">Cure Wounds</a> spell, recovers a reduced amount of hit points. This reduction is equal to their current neural load (rounded up).</p>

			<h5 id="carapace">Carapace Augmentations</h5>
			<p>Carapace augments are shells of metal and connectiion points installed on the outer layers of the body, keeping bones, muscles and organs intact. Partial carapaces only replace part of the skin, allowing skin augments, whereas complete carapaces replace the outer layers entirely.</p>

			<h5 id="limb">Limb Augmentations</h5>
			<p>Including prosthetic arms and legs, external augmentations are some of the most obvious and common types of augments in Valastar. Limb augments have their own Strength and Dexterity scores, seperate from your own. When a d20 roll requires one of these scores while using two or more limbs, you use the average score between the limbs for the roll. Limb augments replace a limb unless otherwise stated.</p>
