			<h3>An Industrial World</h3>
			<p>Valastar has many more options available to its citizens than many DnD worlds, with industry, machinery and power in the form of flux being widely available, if you have the coin of course. The following series of tables contain many options for players and NPCs to spend their hard earned wealth on.</p>

			<h5>Currency</h5>
			<p>While the city itself does have a singular central currency, there are institutions that produce their own currencies with their own limitations, specifically many of the factories in the Furnaces and the Order Solarus. The central currency is usually accepted anywhere, though institution specific currencies may have reduced or even no value outside of its institution of origin.</p>

			<p><em>*Factory currencies are virtually worthless outside of the specific factory that it originates from. The few outsiders who do accept it (usually closely working factories or businesses) do so from one half to as little as one tenth of the currency's value. All others refuse such currency.<br>
			**The currency of Order Solarus was made to be a way for the Order to pay for public works, though as it was never backed in anything it quickly became virtually worthless. As such, it is only accepted by the deeply devout and order itself, with payments made in Order currency usually being seen as a donation instead of a transaction.</em></p>

			<h5>Food and Drink</h5>
			<p>What you eat and drink varies wildly by where and how you live, ranging from dirty water from public pumps and the foul tasting paste known as gruel, to full on banquets with fresh fruits, vegetables and real, actual meat. Below is a list of food and drink items with their associated prices. These prices are simply base prices, and can vary dramatically based on availability and quality.</p>

			<h5>Services</h5>
			<p>With such a large and diverse population, Valastar boasts a deeply varied list of potential professions, both legal and unsavory. As such, whatever someone needs done, there is almost certainly someone willing to do it, provided their fees are paid. These costs are only the starting point, with luxurious and riskier variants costing far more, if available at all.</p>

			<p><strong>Liscences.</strong> Not every item is legal to own and use. Restricted item liscenses allow legal use of restricted items, and must be attached to an identity card. Fake idenities require a DC 10 + 2 per rank Intelligence(Investigation) check to recognize as fake, and can have a max rank of 10.</p>
			<p><strong>Medical Attention.</strong> Sometimes having access to a doctor can save a life. Medical attention can be used to treat diseases or poison, recover hit points or remove scars over time (similar to the regenerate spell). A public doctor works in a public office, with all the prying eyes and bystanders that entails. Private doctors will visit a patient's home, but must still record and report any procedures they do to public records. Finally a discrete doctor can provide medical services without any paper trail leading back to a client.</p>
			<p><strong>Verti-rail</strong> A series of track based vehicles somewhere between a trolley and elevator. This system is city wide and is the most accessible mode of transportation. Though, despite politicians' promises for citizens to be able to travel anywhere in the city for 2 pennies, identification cards, hostile "security" checkpoints and predatory ticket sellers make moving across levels far more difficult than the small fee entails.</em></p>
