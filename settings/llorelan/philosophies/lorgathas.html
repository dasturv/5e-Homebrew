				Philosophy: Lorgathas
			</div>

			<h3>Lorgathas</h3>

			<!-- Description (Name, Ideals, Goals and Worldview it Promotes) -->
			<p>Literally meaning "seek joy", Lorgathas is a philosophy built completely around joy. Its practitioners, known as the Athaduine, believe that only through joy and emotional experience can one be fulfilled. Its teachings encourages followers to embrace wanderlust, feelings of love and find the joy hidden in the world around themselves.</p>

			<!-- Cosmology/Metaphysical Beliefs (Nature of Reality, Death, Souls, Etc.) -->
			<h5>Cosmology</h5>
			<p>Lorgathas does not put any significant emphasis on the afterlife, souls or structure of reality. To the Athaduine, there are far smarter and better equipped people who have tried and failed to answer these great questions, so what hope do they have to add to it? Lorgathas teaches there is no point wasting time on unanswerable questions when the very real, very proveable lives of all the bugs in Llorelan are happening right now. According to them, the only thing we know is that we exist now, and we need to focus on being happy with the time we do have.</p>

			<!-- Usual Followers/Regions -->
			<h5>Followers</h5>
			<p>While originating with the Amhrani, the simple and attractive nature of Lorgathas has led to its adoption throughout Llorelan. Artists, explorers and other free-spirited bugs flock to the ideals of Lorgathas. On the fouler side, many dark-minded bugs have turned to Lorgathas as justification for exploiting others for pleasure or spreading misery through drugs or other such substances. From the outside, most bugs see the Athaduine as fun but mercurial at best, to lazy and selfish at worst.</p>

			<!-- Structure/Heirarchy (How is it spread/taught) -->
			<h5>Structure</h5>
			<p>With such an emphasis on freedom and individualism, there is no structure whatsoever within Lorgathas. Most followers learn of the philosophy through word of mouth, from wandering minstrels, charismatic criminals and even nobles who, while trying to besmirch the philosophy, accidently make an attractive pitch to fed up peasants.</p>

			<!-- Factions (Name, prominence, relationships with other factions) -->
			<h5>Factions</h5>
			<p><strong>Faighathas</strong><br>
			The original form of the philosophy, Faighathas means "find joy". The followers of Faighathas focus on creating, spreading and finding merriment and love in every corner of the world. Gathering in groups called troupes, they travel the world in search of adventure and the downtrodden, bringing music, humor and a sense of wonder wherever they go.</p>
			<p><strong>Glacathas</strong><br>
			A twisted mockery of Faighathas, the philosophy of Glacathas translates to "take joy". Originating from the Doraithe (the banished Amhrani), Glacathas teaches that joy and pleasure isn't meant to be spread, but taken. To the followers of Glacathas, pleasure is a limited resource, and accanot be gained without someone else's loss.</p>
