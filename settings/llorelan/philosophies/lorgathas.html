				Philosophy: Lorgathas
			</div>

			<h3>Lorgathas</h3>

			<!-- Description (Name, Ideals, Goals and Worldview it Promotes) -->
			<p>Literally meaning "seek joy", Lorgathas is a philosophy built completely around joy. Its practitioners, known as the Athaduine, believe that only through joy and emotional experience can one be fulfilled. Its teachings encourages followers to embrace wanderlust, feelings of love and find the joy hidden in the world around themselves.</p>

			<!-- Cosmology/Metaphysical Beliefs (Nature of Reality, Death, Souls, Etc.) -->
			<h5>Cosmology</h5>
			<p>Lorgathas does not put any significant emphasis on the afterlife, souls or structure of reality. To the Athaduine, there are far smarter and better equipped people who have tried and failed to answer these great questions, so what hope do they have to add to it? Lorgathas teaches there is no point wasting time on unanswerable questions when the very real, very proveable lives of all the bugs in Llorelan are happening right now. According to them, the only thing we know is that we exist now, and we need to focus on being happy with the time we do have.</p>

			<!-- Usual Followers/Regions -->
			<h5>Followers</h5>
			<p>While originating with the Amhrani, the simple and attractive nature of Lorgathas has led to its adoption throughout Llorelan. Artists, explorers and other free-spirited bugs flock to the ideals of Lorgathas. On the fouler side, many dark-minded bugs have turned to Lorgathas as justification for exploiting others for pleasure or spreading misery through drugs or other such substances. From the outside, most bugs see the Athaduine as fun but mercurial at best, to lazy and selfish at worst.</p>

			<!-- Structure/Heirarchy (How is it spread/taught) -->
			<h5>Structure</h5>
			<p>With such an emphasis on freedom and individualism, it is no surprise that the Athaduine have very little in formal structure. However, many Athaduine form groups called troupes. The troupes are constantly shifting and changing, with no restrictions on who can join nor when members may cut ties, many followers of Lorgathas have spent at least some time within a troupe throughout their lives. Each troupe has a de facto leader, the Stuthior or troupe-master. The only way to become a Stuthior is to create a successful troupe or inherit one from a former Stuthior (a difficult task, as most troupes simply dissolve when their leader dies or retires).</p>

			<!-- Factions (Name, prominence, relationships with other factions) -->
			<h5>Factions</h5>
			<p><strong>Faighathas</strong><br>
			The original form of the philosophy, Faighathas means "find joy". The followers of Faighathas focus on creating, spreading and finding merriment and love in every corner of the world. They wander and explore, seeking adventure, beauty and people to entice and enthrall. Troupes that follow Faighathas are nomadic bands of artists, musicians, actors and adventurers who live as a moving festival. Towns within the route of such troupes can expect weeklong celebrations, performances and merriment making before the troupe moves on. Followers of Faighathas see Glacathas as a perversion and an insult to the philosophy of Lorgathas.</p>
			<p><strong>Glacathas</strong><br>
			A twisted mockery of Faighathas, the philosophy of Glacathas translates to "take joy". Originating from the Doraithe (the banished Amhrani), Glacathas teaches that joy and pleasure isn't meant to be spread, but taken. To the followers of Glacathas, pleasure is a limited resource, and it cannot be gained without someone else's loss. Troupes that follow Glacathas form roving band of bandits and theives, or more insidiously, disguise themselves as a troupe of Faighathas followers. Such a troupe works hard to keep its identity a secret as it leaches off of the communities it finds itself in. To followers of Glacathas, Faighathas is a balm for the naive and stupid who have neither the stomach nor wit to recognize the world for what it is.</p>

			<!-- Key Figures (Name, prominence, history) -->
			<h5>Key Figures</h5>
			<p><strong>Fenidilix the Dragonfly</strong><br>
			The greatest troupe-master of the age, the late Gaelin Amhrani Fenidilix and his troupe "The Wind Walkers" did the daring feat of travelling directly to the Dragon Spire, the home of the mighty and dangerous dragonflies. It is said that his weeklong performance of "The King, the Boy and the Sea" was so moving that every dragonfly on the isle was enthralled. On the conclusion of his visit, thirteen ancient dragonflies gifted him treasures of wonderous power and beauty in thanks for his touching rendition, and gave him the honorific title of Dragonfly. After his death, his troupe dissolved, believing it to be impossible to match the legacy Fenidilix left. As for his treasure, no one alive knows where it is nor what happened to it.</p>
			<p><strong>Old Whistler</strong><br>
			The identity of Old Whistler is a mystery. One part myth, one part bogeyman, the Old Whistler has been thought to be the spirit of the first Doraithe, founder of Glacathas, or sometimes a dark spirit that split from the Singing Stones themselves, or (less dramatically) merely a title given to the current leader of the Glacathas Athaduine. Regardless of who or what it is, it is feared by the Athaduine, and when it calls, the followers of Glacathas obey.</p>

			<!-- Core Tenets -->
			<h5>Tenets</h5>
			<p>The specific tenets of Lorgathas vary wildly between Glacathas, Faighathas, different troupes and even by individual practicioners. Despite this, most of the Athaduine share these beliefs:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Pleasure gives life its meaning. Seek out joy and beauty wherever you go.</li>
				<li>Joy is a personal, individual experience. Find what makes you happy.</li>
				<li>Do not let yourself be caged. Only through freedom and self-expression can one find true happiness.</li>
				<li>Life is an active, brilliant thing, don't watch idly while it passes by.</li>
			</ul>

			<!-- Core Taboos -->
			<h5>Taboos</h5>
			<p>What the Athaduine considers taboo greatly depends on if they follow Glacathas or Faighathas:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Never inflict undue pain on yourself nor others. To cause suffering is to reduce the joy in the world. (Faighathas)</li>
				<li>Do not hoard pleasurable things for yourself. Greed is a sickness that makes happiness impossible. (Faighathas)</li>
				<li>Never pass an opportunity to take what you want. To show pity or reluctance is to invite another to take from you. (Glacathas)</li>
				<li>Do not restrain yourself. Extract whatever pleasure you can from something and discard it. Doing any less means someone else will take that pleasure instead. (Glacathas)</li>
			</ul>

			<!-- Societal Impacts (Positive and Conflicting) -->
			<h5>Impacts on Society</h5>
			<p>Lorgathas is, by its nature, a disruptive ideology. It's promotion of pleasure, freedom and individualism makes it incredibly dangerous to the status quo, and incredibly enticing to anyone who feel disregarded by that status quo. There are many examples of local leaders barring troupes from their towns or outright banning the practice of Lorgathas. Despite this suppression, or perhaps because of it, those seeking to undermine despotic rulers often use a troupe as a place to gather and share information. There have been many revolts and riots started by a clever bard implanted in a troupe using the stage to mock dictators and inspire the general populace.</p>

			<!-- Symbolism, Colors, Ceremonies and Adornments -->
			<h5>Symbolism and Practices</h5>
			<p>To the Athadiune, symbolism is as important as breathing. Their poems and performances are filled with vivid allegory, their carraiges and costumes covered from top to bottom with delicate patterns and images of beautiful things. Flowers, stars, clouds, rolling hills, nude forms, instruments and anything else that could be considered beautiful are beloved to the point of sanctity to the Athaduine.</p>
