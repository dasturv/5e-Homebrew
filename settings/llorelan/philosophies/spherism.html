				Philosophy: Spherism
			</div>

			<h3>Spherism</h3>

			<!-- Description (Name, Ideals, Goals and Worldview it Promotes) -->
			<p>Deriving its name from the concept of the planar spheres that make up both the seen and unseen realms, Spherism is less of a guide of how to live one's life and more of a framework of understanding. Often seen as more scientific than other philosophies, followers of Spherism (called Spherists) seek to lay bare the secrets of the cosmos through experimentation, contemplation and debate.</p>

			<!-- Cosmology/Metaphysical Beliefs (Nature of Reality, Death, Souls, Etc.) -->
			<h5>Cosmology</h5>
			<p>Spherists have no universal agreement for the structure of reality (nor much of anything, really), but most believe the seen and unseen worlds are split up into four spheres, with variations based on experience and culture:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The First Sphere (Celestia), also known as the Sphere of Light or Sphere of Fire, is one of the outer spheres. It brings drive and purpose, but trying to be too close to it can consume oneself in scorching radiance.</li>
				<li>The Second Sphere (Tophet), also known as the Sphere of Thought or Sphere of Air, is one of the middle spheres. All ideas, knowledge and thoughts are within the second sphere. With its emphasis on thought, many Spherists consider it the most important of all the spheres.</li>
				<li>The Third Sphere (Llorelan), also known as the Sphere of Solidity or Sphere of Earth, is the other middle sphere. All physical matter can be found within the third sphere.</li>
				<li>The Fourth Sphere (Gehenna), also known as the Sphere of Shadow or Sphere of Water, is one of the outer spheres. Like the first sphere, the fourth sphere is dangerous to mortals, though like water it will cling to souls and drag them down instead of burning them out.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Beyond the structure of the spheres, Spherists agree even less. The concept of souls being an especially divisive topic. While most Spherists believe in souls, usually taking on the beliefs of another philosophy to answer that question, some more extreme Spherists argue that the soul does not exist, and any examples of ghosts, spirits or any other lingering beyond death is merely the ripples of an individual's thoughts and memories slowly fading within the Second Sphere.</p>

			<!-- Usual Followers/Regions -->
			<h5>Followers</h5>
			<p>Followers of Spherism are usually from affluent or privileged backgrounds, as for most bugs the stark reality of needing to afford food and housing prevents the broad education and time for theorizing and experimenting required for engaging with the philosophy. Though this is far from a rule, as many hermits and ascetics can become truly great Spherists through simple lives and deep contemplation. Spherists can be found all throughout the world, though tend to be concentrated in stable and prosperous regions such as the realms of the Abellids and the Whistlewood. Most followers of Spherism would be considered lawful, with an emphasis and neutral or good.</p>

			<!-- Structure/Heirarchy (How is it spread/taught) -->
			<h5>Structure</h5>
			<p>Spherism has no formal heirarchy nor structure, with status and fame deriving from academic achievement, experience and recommendations by prevelant Spherists. The philosophy is predominantly spread through schools and colleges thoughout Llorelan, with eager students clambering over each other to go to private lectures or secure an apprenticeship with important Spherists.</p>

			<!-- Factions (Name, prominence, relationships with other factions) -->
			<h5>Factions</h5>
			<p><strong>Moralists</strong><br>
			Figureheaded (begrugdingly) by the Elytran priest Jed, the Moralists argue that the act of understanding and spiritual growth are intertwined, and failure to consider both led to self defeat and destruction. Being more widely accepted by non-Spherists, the Moralists have been able to raise public scrutiny on the Purist peers and even have legal limitations put onto their opponents within the Westlands.</p>
			<p><strong>Purists</strong><br>
			Originally proposed by the late Scraedai sage Gizoldote, the Purists seek to remove concepts of morality and what they see as "superstitions" within Spherism. They argue that knowledge and truth are the only real morality, and corruption from unproveable sources lead people astray.</p>

			<!-- Key Figures (Name, prominence, history) -->
			<h5>Key Figures</h5>
			<p><strong>Jed Ambershell</strong><br>
			The founder of the Moralist movement, the Elytran priest Jed originally promoted discussion and debate over the future of the Philosophy, but more radical followers and public outrage led his original movement to begin persecuting the Purists. While still considered the leader of the movement, his calls to seek peaceful resolution have largely fell upon deaf ears.</p>
			<p><strong>Gizoldote</strong><br>
			The founder of the Purist movement, the Scraedai sage Gizoldote attempted to remove more spiritual elements from the philosophy. While originally receptive to discussion with the Moralists, even having several amicable debates with their founder Jed, the persecutions of her followers in the Westlands caused her to break ties with the Moralists. She later died in her home in the Whistlewood, bitter with the philosophy she spent her life trying to improve.</p>
			<p><strong>Taljid Bas'Oma</strong><br>
			An important historical Spherist, the Harish scholar Taljid made many important discoveries throughout his life. While not every one of his ideas have withstood the test of time (such as his famous diagram of the spheres), much of his work is considered foundational to Spherism as a whole.</p>
			
			<!-- Core Tenets -->
			<h5>Tenets</h5>
			<p>While Spherists may not often agree on the actual subjects of their study, they do share some ideals throught the philosophy:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>All knowledge is worth knowing. Truth is not inherently dangerous, only ignorance.</li>
				<li>Debate is sacred. Ideas can only be proven in the harsh scrutiny of intelligent peers.</li>
				<li>Never hoard knowledge. Truth is meant to be shared, keeping it for oneself is wrong.</li>
				<li>Always question, always learn. Failure to continue learning is the same as dying.</li>
			</ul>

			<!-- Core Taboos -->
			<h5>Taboos</h5>
			<p>Despite the divisive nature of Spherism (or perhaps because of it), there are rigid codes of academic integrity that must be followed. Failure to do so can lead to ridicule and even outright exiled from the academic community:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Knowingly releasing or promoting a false study. Willfully tainting the pool of knowledge with falsehoods is antithetical to the pursuit of truth.</li>
				<li>Suppressing dissenting opinions. An idea should be able to stand up to scrutiny. Attempting to silence others only shows that you know your idea is wrong.</li>
				<li>Using knowledge to mislead or misrepresent. Using evidence selectively or in bad faith to manipulate others is an abuse of knowledge, and cannot be tolerated.</li>
				<li>Failure to practice caution and due-diligence. Truth must be obtained carefully and steadily, trying to rush merely leads to failure.</li>
			</ul>

			<!-- Societal Impacts (Positive and Conflicting) -->
			<h5>Impacts on Society</h5>
			<p>While the true followers of Spherism are often eccletic and strange to the everyday bug of Llorelan, many of its ideas have trickled into the minds and cultures throughout Llorelan. The Spherist model of reality, as well as many of their other theories on scientific and meta-physical matters are widely accepted, with bugs of other philosophies often adapting or taking Spherist knowledge into their own understanding. Despite the widespread acceptance of Spherism, the vast majority of bugs have little understanding of the going-ons and structure within the philosophy.</p>

			<!-- Symbolism, Colors, Ceremonies and Adornments -->
			<h5>Symbolism and Practices</h5>
			<p>Just like their ideas, how each individual Spherist expresses their philosophy differs. The only widely used symbol for the philosophy is the Taljid diagram, a series of four circles, each overlapping the others besides the outer two, who only overlap the inner two. While the diagram is understood to be a non-literal or even outdated interpretation of the actual structure of the spheres, its simple shape is used as a shorthand symbol for the philosophy as a whole.</p>
