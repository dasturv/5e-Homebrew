				Philosophy: Alisme
			</div>

			<h3>Alisme</h3>

			<!-- Description (Name, Ideals, Goals and Worldview it Promotes) -->
			<p>Alisme roughly translates to altruism or selflessness, and is a philosophy focused on how to be a "good" person. Alisme promotes a sense of community, self sacrifice and chivalrous behavior, a fact that leads its followers to be paragons of virtue and civilization.</p>

			<!-- Cosmology/Metaphysical Beliefs (Nature of Reality, Death, Souls, Etc.) -->
			<h5>Cosmology</h5>
			<p>The philosophy of Alisme is deeply intertwined with the worship of good deities, particularly the Twins and the Radiant Trio. As such, it is believed that living a life in service of good will lead to an afterlife of bliss within the realms of these gods. For the followers of Alisme, it is thought that a soul is judged upon death, being sentenced to peace, mediocrity or suffering based on the actions committed in life.</p>

			<!-- Usual Followers/Regions -->
			<h5>Followers</h5>
			<p>While Alisme itself is an ancient philosophy, its modern form has been deeply shaped by the Twin Goddesses and their children, with the strongest concentration of the philosophy occuring in the lands controlled by the sister races. The philosophy is often picked up by those faithful to good deities, knightly orders, and those seeking redemption. To other bugs, followers of Alisme are seen as beacons of good, disciplined and selfless.</p>

			<!-- Structure/Heirarchy (How is it spread/taught) -->
			<h5>Structure</h5>
			<p>Alisme itself does not have its own structure, instead using the structure of the organizations who spread the philosophy. Lords of knightly orders, High Priestesses of good deities and founders of humanitarian organizations are all seen as honored and respected members of the philosophy. Despite this heirarchical inspiration, anyone who has simply done enough good deeds can be considered on par with these more traditional leaders.</p>

			<!-- Factions (Name, prominence, relationships with other factions) -->
			<h5>Factions</h5>
			<p><strong>Redeemers</strong><br>
			As the name may suggest, the redeemers are focused on saving the bugs of Llorelan. Taking inspiration from Noxella and the gentler aspects of Evenala, they seek to guide as many bugs as possible into the light. They take an active role in trying to teach the tenets of Alisme, and as such are particularly numerous. Their focus on aiding others make them natural allies for the Activists, but their mission of redemption stands in direct opposition to the Templars.</p>
			<p><strong>Activists</strong><br>
			Unlike many of the other followers of Alisme, Activists have little desire to directly convert others into the philosophy. They instead believe that simply doing good in the world will lead to more turning to the light naturally, therefore saving them. Often found doing humanitarian or diplomatic work, their active nature means they often work with the Redeemers, but the isolationism of the Hermits is seen as selfish.</p>
			<p><strong>Templars</strong><br>
			The Templars are the swords and shields of Alisme, striking out against the darkness and evils of the world. They seek to increase the influence of good in Llorelan by fighting and defeating evil wherever it can be found. Knights, paladins and other warriors flock to the Templars. The Templars are particularly close to the Hermits, seeing them as moral guides and sources of wisdom. They see the Redeemers, however, as naive, believing they lack the courage to truly combat evil.</p>
			<p><strong>Hermits</strong><br>
			The least numerous and active faction, the Hermits live their lives as ascetics, meditating on the nature of good and evil. They believe that only through isolation and self denial can one truly know good and evil. They often spend long stretches of time in far off locales, only coming to civilization for supplies or share their insights. The Templars desire for the Hermits wisdom leads to the closest ties the Hermits have, whereas the apparent worldliness of the Activists means they rarely see to eye to eye.</p>
