				Philosophy: Montiku-mono
			</div>

			<h3>Montiku-mono</h3>

			<!-- Description (Name, Ideals, Goals and Worldview it Promotes) -->
			<p>Roughly translated to "what you take with you", Montiku-mono is a philosophy about freeing oneself from the sorrows and weakness of the physical world in order to reach spiritual purity. Its teachings promote a constant and active pursuit towards improvement, a fact that leads its followers to live disciplined and passionate lives.</p>

			<!-- Cosmology/Metaphysical Beliefs (Nature of Reality, Death, Souls, Etc.) -->
			<h5>Cosmology</h5>
			<p>Followers of Montiku-mono believe whatever you accept in life follows you into the afterlife. Wisdom, discipline and action leads to a soul that can stand tall and bright amongst the dead, whereas things such as cowardice, illness and uncontrolled anger leave the soul blighted and deformed. They believe that it is regret and lack of control that creates a personal hell for the dead, and only through purging the body and soul of such sins can that pain be avoided.</p>

			<!-- Usual Followers/Regions -->
			<h5>Followers</h5>
			<p>Originally created by and deeply intertwined with the Kamakri, the teachings of Montiku-mono nonetheless has spread to bugs of all types. Attractive to those seeking enlightment, discipline, or even simply a way to purge themselves of regret and suffering, the followers of Montiku-mono are often seen as intense and sometimes off-putting to other bugs.</p>

			<!-- Structure/Heirarchy (How is it spread/taught) -->
			<h5>Structure</h5>
			<p>While there are many monasteries and warrior-bands that practice and teach the ways of Montiku-mono, the only truly recognized structure by its followers is the relationship of student and teacher. There is no centralized leadership nor organization beyond the long branching paths of mentors and mentees. According to followers of Montiku-mono, the act of passing down wisdom from master to pupil purifies the souls of both.</p>

			<!-- Factions (Name, prominence, relationships with other factions) -->
			<h5>Factions</h5>
			<p><strong>Hodoku</strong><br>
			The practice of Hodoku (meaning to untie or untether) is a version of Montiku-mono developed by the Ran-Kamakri with guidance of the Great Tree Goddess, Kishima. Practitioners of Hodoku seek to free themselves of suffering and regret through meditation and enlightenment. While just as active in pursuit of perfection as any other followers of Montiku-mono, they learn to let go of things outside of their control, mastering restraint and patience.</p>
			<p><strong>Tatakai</strong><br>
			The original form of Montiku-mono created by the Ken-Kamakri, the practice of Tatakai (meaning fight) teaches one to face struggles head on. To the practitioners of Tatakai, the only way to not accept the corupting influences of the world is to oppose them, and so they fight, both literally and metaphorically. The point is not victory, but to never accept defeat. The most extreme followers of Tatakai go as far to believe dying of old age or disease is a form of accepting defeat, and so seek to die in battle against a worthy opponent.</p>

			<!-- Key Figures (Name, prominence, history) -->
			<h5>Key Figures</h5>
			<p><strong>Tomatsu Hidaka-Kishima</strong><br>
			The ancient Kamakri demigod Tomatsu is both the founder of Hodoku and the race of Ran-Kamakri. Once a mighty warlord known for his bloodlust and martial prowess, he wandered in sorrow after slaying his brother Takumi in a fit of rage. In sorrow he came unaware to the base of the tree goddess Kishima, and through quiet communion he found enlightenment. Though immortal, he sought to cleanse his soul of regret and suffering, teaching his followers to do the same. It is said that he left his followers long ago, climbing to the highest boughs of his goddess in search of true enlightenment.</p>
			<p><strong>Shuji Amano-Kaito-Miyo</strong><br>
			An ancient Ken-Kamakri warlord, Shuji once united all of the warbands of the Kamakri under his own banner, the only time in known history such a feat was done. Seen as a mighty warrior, leader and teacher, Shuji is a deeply respected folk hero, even by the usually peaceful Ran-Kamakri.</p>
			<p><strong>Iddilig Radani</strong><br>
			The most famous of non-Kamakri followers of Montiku-mono, Iddilig was a Doraithe, or Banished Amhrani. Learning from the teachings of both Hodoku and Tatakai, she and her followers traveled north out of the Savage Lands and settled alongside the bugs there, despite the long held and often deserved enmity towards her kind. She proved herself to be a valuable ally, however, even helping defend her new home against raids from other Doraithe. Her actions led to the invitation for her and her followers to travel further north, back to their original homeland, though they refused. Still, their actions have opened the door for these "redeemed" Doraithe to make pilgrimages to the Singing stones, making them the only ones of their kinds capable of creating music. The settlements and populations her followers created still exist, creating a unique cultural blend of Montiku-mono and Faighathas.</p>

			<!-- Core Tenets -->
			<h5>Tenets</h5>
			<p>While differing greatly between Hodoku and Tatakai, Montiku-mono as a whole has many core tenets that all its practitioners follow:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Do not sit idle. Improvement is a process that must always be strived for.</li>
				<li>Do not lose yourself to emotion. Only through discipline and self-understanding can the stains of rage, sorrow and regret be purged from the soul.</li>
				<li>Do not let others be the master of your mind. To let others control your emotions or goad you is to put your soul in their hands.</li>
				<li>Neither fear death nor seek it. To hold onto the fear of death blights the soul, but to die before one can properly reach a state of purity does so as well.</li>
				<li>Do not cling to things beyond you. To hold onto something one cannot control is to mark one's soul forever. Let go of it.</li>
				<li>Know oneself. Without understanding of one's own failings and place in the world, it is impossible to become pure.</li>
			</ul>

			<!-- Core Taboos -->
			<h5>Taboos</h5>
			<p>With an emphasis on spiritual purity, practitioners have several taboos, acts that stain the souls of either the actor or the victim:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Never control the mind of another through magic or lies. To actively corrupt the soul of another is an act that corrupts one's own soul even greater.</li>
				<li>Illness and poisons are corrupting forces, to die of either is a mark on ones soul. The greater the illness or poison, the deeper the corruption. To inflict either upon another is a grevious sin.</li>
				<li>Do not dishonor or insult the teachings of your mentor. To turn your back on the one seeking to guide you to spiritual purity is to turn one's back against themself.</li>
			</ul>

			<!-- Societal Impacts (Positive and Conflicting) -->
			<h5>Impacts on Society</h5>
			<p>As intense as Montiku-mono can be, its widespread adoption is uncommon beyond the regions the Kamakri call home. In those regions, the practice is often the rule of the land, dictating proper and improper ways of living and interacting. However, the Kamakri tradition of taking non-Kamakri as students and especially the Ken-Kamakri willingness to serve as mercenaries across the world has caused the teachings of Montiku-mono to have small but real footholds especially within military structures.</p>

			<!-- Symbolism, Colors, Ceremonies and Adornments -->
			<h5>Symbolism and Practices</h5>
			<p>The practice of Montiku-mono is deeply steeped with imagery, allegory and allusions to works that take a lifetime to fully understand. Symbolism using natural parts of the world such as beasts, plants or weather are common, oftentimes with both cultural and personal meanings. Many practitioners spend long hours, days and even months contemplating poems, artworks or teachings of great teachers, slowly unravelling the nuance and subtle references to understand the lesson contained. It is believed that the act of untangling this complex web of history and art mirrors the act of untangling and understanding one's self, and will lead to greater enlightenment.</p>
