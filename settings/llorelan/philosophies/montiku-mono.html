			</div>

			<h3>Montiku-mono</h3>

			<!-- Description (Name, Ideals, Goals and Worldview it Promotes) -->
			<p>Roughly translated to "what you take with you", Montiku-mono is a philosophy about freeing oneself from the sorrows and weakness of the physical world in order to reach spiritual purity. Its teachings promote a constant and active pursuit towards improvement, a fact that leads its followers to live disciplined and passionate lives.</p>

			<!-- Cosmology/Metaphysical Beliefs (Nature of Reality, Death, Souls, Etc.) -->
			<h5>Cosmology</h5>
			<p>Followers of Montiku-mono believe whatever you accept in life follows you into the afterlife. Wisdom, discipline and action leads to a soul that can stand tall and bright amongst the dead, whereas things such as cowardice, illness and uncontrolled anger leave the soul blighted and deformed. They believe that it is regret and lack of control that creates a personal hell for the dead, and only through purging the body and soul of such sins can that pain be avoided.</p>

			<!-- Usual Followers/Regions -->
			<h5>Followers</h5>
			<p>Originally created by and deeply intertwined with the Kamakri, the teachings of Montiku-mono nonetheless has spread to bugs of all types. Attractive to those seeking enlightment, discipline, or even simply a way to purge themselves of regret and suffering, the followers of Montiku-mono are often seen as intense and sometimes off-putting to other bugs.</p>

			<!-- Structure/Heirarchy (How is it spread/taught) -->
			<h5>Structure</h5>
			<p>While there are many monasteries and warrior-bands that practice and teach the ways of Montiku-mono, the only truly recognized structure by its followers is the relationship of student and teacher. There is no centralized leadership nor organization beyond the long branching paths of mentors and mentees. According to followers of Montiku-mono, the act of passing down wisdom from master to pupil purifies the souls of both.</p>

			<!-- Factions (Name, prominence, relationships with other factions) -->
			<h5>Factions</h5>
			<p><strong>Hodoku</strong><br>
			The practice of Hodoku (meaning to untie or untether) is a version of Montiku-mono developed by the Ran-Kamakri with guidance of the Great Tree Goddess, Kishima. Practitioners of Hodoku seek to free themselves of suffering and regret through meditation and enlightenment. While just as active in pursuit of perfection as any other followers of Montiku-mono, they learn to let go of things outside of their control, mastering restraint and patience.</p>
			<p><strong>Tatakai</strong><br>
			The original form of Montiku-mono created by the Ken-Kamakri, the practice of Tatakai (meaning fight) teaches one to face struggles head on. To the practitioners of Tatakai, the only way to not accept the corupting influences of the world is to oppose them, and so they fight, both literally and metaphorically. The point is not victory, but to never accept defeat. The most extreme followers of Tatakai go as far to believe dying of old age or disease is a form of accepting defeat, and so seek to die in battle against a worthy opponent.</p>

			<!-- Key Figures (Name, prominence, history) -->
			<h5>Key Figures</h5>
			<p><strong>Tomatsu Hidaka</strong><br>
			The ancient Kamakri demigod Tomatsu is both the founder of Hodoku and the race of Ran-Kamakri. Once a mighty warlord known for his bloodlust and martial prowess, he wandered in sorrow after slaying his brother Takumi in a fit of rage. In sorrow he came unaware to the base of the tree goddess Kishima, and through quiet communion he found enlightenment. Though immortal, he sought to cleanse his soul of regret and suffering, teaching his followers to do the same. It is said that he left his followers long ago, climbing to the highest boughs of his goddess in search of true enlightenment.</p>
			<p><strong>Shuji Amano</strong><br>
			An ancient Ken-Kamakri warlord, Shuji once united all of the warbands of the Kamakri under his own banner, the only time in known history such a feat was done. Seen as a mighty warrior, leader and teacher, Shuji is a deeply respected folk hero, even by the usually peaceful Ran-Kamakri.</p>
