				Philosophy: Bhurgism
			</div>

			<h3>Bhurgism</h3>

			<!-- Description (Name, Ideals, Goals and Worldview it Promotes) -->
			<p>Named after the old Elytran name for a city, Bhurgism promotes the ideals of those early Elytran settlements, namely free trade, the cooperative accrual of wealth, healthy competition, civic engagement and the centrality of the Guilds. According to the ideals of Bhurgism, there is no greater act than to work with your community, whether that be your town, your guild or your family, in order to create more wealth and comfort. While it may seem the Bhurgism promotes a strongly individualistic ideology (which to some extent, it does), the focus of Bhurgism on cooperation and community prevents most followers from falling into the trappings of selfishness. After all, no bug can survive purely on their own.</p>

			<!-- Cosmology/Metaphysical Beliefs (Nature of Reality, Death, Souls, Etc.) -->
			<h5>Cosmology</h5>
			<p>Bhurgism has nothing to say on the metaphysical. To the Bhurgists, such questions are for other philosophies to answer. Bhurgism is focused solely and stubbornly on the physical world and the bugs within.</p>

			<!-- Usual Followers/Regions -->
			<h5>Followers</h5>
			<p>The philosophy of Bhurgism is most widely accepted by the Guilds and their members. A fact not surprising given that they both developed alongside one another from the early days of the Elytrans. Outside of the Guilds, Bhurgism is often taken up by merchants and those living in urban areas. The Abellids and Formids are actually some of the most fervent of adopters of this once predominantly Elytran philosophy.</p>

			<!-- Structure/Heirarchy (How is it spread/taught) -->
			<h5>Structure</h5>
			<p>While this is no formal structure for the spread of Bhurgism, the Guilds come pretty close. The Guilds are organizations each based around a specific trade or profession that hold immense political, economic and cultural sway. Each Guild has its own unique structure, but generally is made up of members (the practicers of the Guild's craft), Masters (who run the local branches of each Guild) and Grandmasters (who serve as the highest authority for the Guild as a whole). Guilds very rarely have a single individual in power, with various other roles, councils and regulations set in place to limit any power an ambitious bug could obtain.</p>

			<!-- Factions (Name, prominence, relationships with other factions) -->
			<h5>Factions</h5>
			<p><strong>Centralists</strong><br>
			The Centralists are a sub-faction of Bhurgism that promotes first and foremost towns and cities. Seeing such population centers as the prime example of Bhurgist ideals, they seek to concentrate industry and populations into bustling hives of productivity. They most deeply disagree with the Commercialists, though they often have overlap with the Republicans.</p>
			<p><strong>Commercialists</strong><br>
			To the Commercialists, there is nothing greater than finding new markets to explore. Full of explorers and adventurous sorts, the Commercialists seek to find new bugs to open up trade with. The most famous of the Commercialists are the members of the Seafarers Guild, who have made trade between East and West possible. Commercialists fundamentally clash with Centralists, but often like the more far-reaching ideas of the Fundamentalists.</p>
			<p><strong>Republicans</strong><br>
			The Republicans most love the Bhurgist ideals of civic engagement, allowing all bugs (even those outside of the Guilds) to have a say in their own governance. For the Republicans, authoritarianism in any form stifles the ability for markets to grow, evolve and adapt. Teh Republicans vehemently oppose the Fundamentalists, though they often find allies amongst the Centralists.</p>
			<p><strong>Fundamentalists</strong><br>
			Despite their name, the Fundamentalists are a relatively new faction within Bhurgism. Their goal is the elevation of the Guilds as a structure, even above the cities and towns where the Guilds do business. According to the Fundamentalists, the wealth of a single city or town is worth very little, after all, those comforts are limited to that settlement, but the wealth of the Guilds have the ability to shape the lives of bugs everywhere the Guilds do business. The Fundamentalists clash often with the Republicans over how much authority the Guilds should have in local politics, though their goals of reaching all corners of the world make the Commercialists natural allies.</p>

			<!-- Societal Impacts (Positive and Conflicting) -->
			<h5>Impacts on Society</h5>
			<p>Bhurgism holds immense sway, especially in the Westlands. Even the mighty Abellids must find compromise with the Guilds in order to maintain their power. Despite this political power, the decentralized nature of the Guilds and Bhurgism as a whole prevents any overly despotic influences. For most bugs, the presence of the Guilds makes life more complicated, but far more comfortable and enjoyable.</p>

			<!-- Symbolism, Colors, Ceremonies and Adornments -->
			<h5>Symbolism and Practices</h5>
			<p>While Bhurgists don't seem like a philosophy that would put much weight into symbols and ritual, the fact that most Guilds have their roots so far back that their origins have been last means they have a dense language of symbols and traditions to pull upon. Whether that be Guild heraldry bearing creatures or plants that hold some cultural significance (or once did), or complex systems and rituals to swear in new members and Guild leaders, each Guild has at least some quirks beyond simply making money.</p>
