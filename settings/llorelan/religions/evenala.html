			<!-- Description (Titles, Ideals, Goals and Worldview they Promote) -->
			<h3>The Amber Queen, Heavenly Mother, the Radiant Sister. All are names for Evenala, the goddess of the Abellids and twin sister of Alowe. Evenala is a surprisingly active deity, much akin to her beloved Abellids. She strives always to improve the lives of her followers, teaching them to cooperate, be loyal to one another, build communities and fiercely defend those communities they have built. Unlike her sister though, Evenala welcomes outside species into the ranks of her followers. Through this openness followers of Evenala hope to one day unite the whole world in peaceful, energetic community.</h3>

			<!-- Cosmology/Metaphysical Beliefs (Nature of Reality, Death, Souls, Etc.) -->
			<h5>Cosmology</h5>
			<p>The followers of Evenala know that their goddess is a young one. She did not create the world, but instead of being a mark against her, the followers of the Amber Queen find pride in just how much their goddess has done in her (relatively) short time. The Abellid empire stretched from the northern most point of the Westlands all the way to the Dreadmoor. To them, Evenala's power and wisdom is self evident, with nearly a continent worth's of devotees. It is believed that when a follower of Evenala dies, their spirit goes to her realm within the Unseen, known as Paradis, in order to join her and all the other souls of the devout. Whether or not fallen followers are allowed into the holy realm is a topic of great debate amongst Evenala's followers, with beliefs ranging from outright banishment and annihiliation to merely a time of contemplation before being allowed into the fold.</p>

			<!-- Usual Followers/Regions -->
			<h5>Followers</h5>
			<p>The most obvious and common followers of Evenala are of course the Abellids. As the direct creations of Evenala, her worship is nearly universal amongst their number. Beyond them, most Formids at least offer some praise towards Evenala (though full conversion away from Alowe is exceedingly rare). The priestesses of Evenala, however, have found Elytrans to be the easiest and most devout of converts, with their love of community, collaboration and close relationship with the Abellids making Evenala an easy transition. Evenala is the most widely worshipped divine in the Westlands, but is very rarely worshipped in the east.</p>
