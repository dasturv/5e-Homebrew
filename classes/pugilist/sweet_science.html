				Pugilist: The Sweet Science
			</div>
			<p>
				<strong><em>
					The true masters of the craft of hitting hard, fast and often. Pugilists that follow the Sweet Science dedicate themselves wholly to the art of brawling. While some may call such pugilists simple or brutish, the followers of the Sweet Science know something their detractors don't: it's damn hard to beat a knock out punch to the nose.
				</em></strong>
				<h3>Bare Knuckle Boxer</h3>
				<p>Starting when you choose this fight club at 3rd level, your unarmed strikes score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.</p>
				<h3>Cross Counter</h3>
				<p>Also starting at 3rd level, you can block the brunt of an attack and launch one yourself in the same fluid motion. When you take damage from a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction and spend 2 moxie points to reduce the damage by 1d10 + your Strength modifier + your pugilist level.</p>
				<p>If you reduce the damage to 0, you can make an unarmed strike or pugilist weapon attack against a creature within your reach as part of the same reaction</p>
				<h3>One, Two, Three, Floor</h3>
				<p>Beginning at 6th level, when you use a bonus action to use your Old One-Two feature and hit the same creature with both attacks, you can expend 1 moxie point to make an additional unarmed strike against that creature as part of the same bonus action. If it hits, the creature is knocked prone in addition to taking damage as normal for your unarmed strike.</p>
				<h3>Float Like a Butterfly, Sting Like a Bee</h3>
				<p>Starting at 11th level, whenever you reduce damage from an attack to 0 and hit a creature with your Cross Counter feature, you regain 1 expended moxie point.</p>
				<h3>Knock Out</h3>
				<p>By 17th level, you have mastered the art of the knock out punch. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike you may expend 5 moxie points. After the damage from the unarmed strike is resolved, if the creature has less than 100 hit points it is immediately reduced to 0 hit points. A creature rendered unconsious by this feature is automatically stabilized. Once you reduce a creature to 0 hit points this way, you cannot use this feature again until you complete a long rest.</p>
