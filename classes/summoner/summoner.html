			<ul>
				<li>(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon</li>
				<li>(a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus</li>

				<li>Leather armor and any simple weapon</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Alternatively, if you are using starting gold, you start with 3d4x10 gp.</p>

			<h3>Summon Eidolon</h3>
			<p>At 1st level you have formed a mystical bond with a spiritual entity known as an Eidolon.</p>
			<h5>Creating Your Eidolon</h5>
			<p>When you gain this feature, choose the stat block for you Eidolon from the list of <a href="eidolon_forms.html">Eidolon Forms</a>, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You determine the appearance of your Eidolon, though the appearance has no mechanical effect. Regardless of the form the Eidolon takes, it bears strange markings, is partially transparent or has some other obvious marking of its mystical origin. Your Eidolon is an Aberration, Celestial, Elemental, Fey, Fiend or Undead (your choice).</p>
			<h5>Controlling Your Eidolon</h5>
			<p>The Eidolon is considered friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. It knows every language you do and you can communicate with it telepathically as long as both are you are on the same plane of existence. In combat your Eidolon acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take an action on your turn telepathically command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, your Eidolon can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</p>
			<h5>Summoning Your Eidolon</h5>
			<p>As long as your Eidolon has at least 1 hit point, you can spend one minute to summon it from its demiplane, causing it to appear in an empty space of your choice within 30 feet of you. Your Eidolon recovers all of its hit points whenever you complete a long rest, regardless of if it is in its demiplane or not.</p>
			<p>Additionally, if your Eidolon is at 0 hit points in its demiplane, you can use an action and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. When you do so, it recovers 1d10 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.</p>
			<h5>Dismissal and Banishment</h5>
			<p>You can dismiss your Eidolon as an action, causing it to return to its demiplane. While in its demiplane the Eidolon cannot complete rests nor recover hit points on its own. If your Eidolon is reduced to 0 hit points or banished through use of the <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:banishment">Banishment</a> spell or other such effect, it also returns to its demiplane, which is considered its home plane.</p>

			<h3>Pact Magic</h3>
			<p>Your bond with your Eidolon and the spiritual realm has granted you the ability to use spells.</p>
			<h5>Cantrips</h5>
			<p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the <a href="summoner_spells.html">summoner spell list</a>. You learn additional summoner cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Summoner table.</p>
			<h5>Spell Slots</h5>
			<p>The Summoner table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your summoner spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your summoner spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p>For example, when you are 9th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:witch-bolt">witch bolt</a>, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</p>
			<h5>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>
			<p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the <a href="summoner_spells.html">summoner spell list</a>.</p>
			<p>The Spells Known column of the Summoner table shows when you learn more summoner spells of your choice of 1st level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new summoner spell, which can be 1st or 2nd level.</p>
			<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the summoner spells you know and replace it with another spell from the summoner spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>
			<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your summoner spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a summoner spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<p><strong>Spell Save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
			<p><strong>Spell Attack Modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
			<h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5>
			<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your summoner spells.</p>

			<h3>Evolutions</h3>
			<p>Your Eidolon is a unique, growing entity, as shown through its <a href="eidolon_evolutions.html">Evolutions</a>.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, you apply two evolutions of your choice to your Eidolon. When you gain certain summoner levels, your Eidolon gains additional evolutions of your choice, as shown in the Evolutions column of the Summoner table. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.</p>
			<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the evolutions applied to your Eidolon and replace it with another evolution that you could select at that level.</p>

			<h3>Bond Senses</h3>
			<p>Also at 2nd level you can experience the world through your Eidolon's senses. As an action, you can see through your Eidolon's eyes and hear what it hears until you use another action to end this effect, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the Eidolon has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.</p>

			<h3>Spiritual Relationship</h3>
			<p>At 3rd level, you have interacted enough with your Eidolon to have developed a relationship with it. Choose a Spiritual Relationship that best exemplifies your relationship with your Eidolon. The relationship you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 9th and 15th level.</p>
			<table class="content-table">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Spiritual Relationship</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><a href="domineering.html">Domineering</a></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><a href="friendly.html">Friendly</a></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><a href="guiding.html">Guiding</a></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><a href="protective.html">Protective</a></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<h5>Relationship Spells</h5>
			<p>Each relationship has a list of spells-its relationship spells that you learn at the summoner levels noted in the relationship description. These spells do not count against the number of spells you know.</p>
			<p>If you have a relationship spell that doesn't appear on the summoner spell list, the spell is nonetheless a summoner spell for you.</p>

			<h3>Ability Score Increase</h3>
			<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>

			<h3>Spiritual Versatility</h3>
			<p>Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one or more of the following, representing both your and your Eidolon's shift in priorities:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Pact Magic feature with another cantrip from the summoner spell list.</li>
				<li>You can change your Eidolon's form to a different one. If you no longer meet the preresequites one or more of your Eidolon's evolutions after this change, those evolutions do not grant any benefits until you meet those preresequites again.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Empowered Bond</h3>
			<p>By 5th level your connection to your Eidolon has grown stronger. You can command it as a bonus action instead of an action.</p>
			<p>In addition, your Eidolon has advantage on saving throws to prevent being banished.</p>

			<h3>Maker's Call</h3>
			<p>At 7th level you gain the ability to summon your Eidolon to your side. As an action you can teleport your Eidolon to an empty space within 5 feet of you, provided you are both on the same plane. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier and regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>

			<h3>Aspects</h3>
			<p>Upon reaching 10th level, your connection to your Eidolon is so strong that you have begun manifesting aspects of it. Choose up to two evolutions you have applied to your Eidolon. Those evolutions are now also applied to you. You can only select first tier evolutions that you meet the preresiquites for.</p>
			<p>At 18th Level you can apply up to two more of your Eidolon's evolutions to yourself, for a total of four. These evolutions can be up to second tier.</p>
			<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the evolutions applied to you with another applied to your Eidolon, provided you meet the preresiquites.</p>

			<h3>Shared Spells</h3>
			<p>Beginning at 11th level, when you cast a spell targeting yourself, you can also affect your Eidolon with the spell if it is within 30 feet of you.</p>

			<h3>Transposition</h3>
			<p>At 13th level, whenever you use your Maker's Call feature, you can choose to instead switch places with your Eidolon, provided there is enough space for each of you at your destination.</p>

			<h3>Essence Bond</h3>
			<p>By 14th level you and your Eidolon are so intertwined that you cannot die while it stands. Whenever you would be reduced to 0 hit points while your Eidolon is on the same plane of existence as you, you are instead reduced to 1 hit point, with any remaining damage magically transferring to your Eidolon. This damage cannot be reduced in any way.</p>

			<h3>Perfected Bond</h3>
			<p>Starting at 17th level, your Eidolon is immune to spells and magical effects that would banish it. You can still dismiss it, and it still returns to its demiplane if it is reduced to 0 hit points.</p>

			<h3>Twin Soul</h3>
			<p>By 20th level you and your Eidolon are so intertwined as to be the same entity. As an action you can magically transform into an exact duplicate of your Eidolon, except you have full hit points and all uses of your Eidolon's abilities. You remain transformed for 10 minutes, until you use an action to revert to your original form, or until you are reduced to 0 hit points. If you are reduced to 0 hit points any remaining damage transfers to your original form.</p>
			<p>Once you use this feature you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
