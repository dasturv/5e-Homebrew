				<h3>Bonus Languages</h3>
				<p>Starting at 1st level when you choose this order, you learn two languages of your choice.</p>
				<h3>Breadth of Knowledge</h3>
				<p>By 6th level, you have learned to passively tap into the wellspring of knowledge around you. Whenever you complete a long rest you gain proficiency with any combination of two skills or tools. You can replace one or both of these proficiencies with a language of your choice instead. These proficiencies and languages are lost when you xomplete your next long rest.</p>
				<h3>Psionic Strikes</h3>
				<p>At 9th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with psionic energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to the target.</p>
				<p>When you reach 17th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>
				<h3>Unseen Step</h3>
				<p>By 14th level, you have mastered the ways of moving unseen. Whenever you would move on your turn, you can forfeit any amount of that movement to teleport that distance instead. You can only use this feature to teleport to a point you can see.</p>
