				<strong><em>
					Mystics who dedicate themselves to the Order of the Awakened seek to unlock the full potential of the mind, capable of warping reality itself with the sheer force of their intellect. Taking little heed in preservation or sanctity, the Awakened probe ever deeper into the powers of psionics.
				</em></strong>
				<h3>Bonus Disciplines</h3>
				<p>You learn bonus disciplines associated with your order. When you select this order at 1st level and again at 10th level, choose a psionic discipline from the Order Disciplines table to learn. These disciplines do not count against the number of disciplines you can know.</p>

				<h3>Bonus Talent</h3>
				<p>Starting at 1st level when you choose this order, you learn one additional <a href="psionic_talents.html">Psionic Talent</a> of your choice. This talent does not count against the number of talents you can know.</p>
				<h3>Psyche Digestion</h3>
				<p>By 6th level you've learned how to sacrifice portions of your mind for more power. As an action you disable an non-disabled psionic discipline you know and recover psi points equal to your psi limit, provided you have at least one discipline you can select. You cannot focus on nor spend psi points on a disabled discipline. If you are focused on or concentrating on a disabled discipline, that focus and/or concentration immediately ends.</p>
				<p>Disabled disciplines are enabled again after you complete a long rest.</p>
				<h3>Potent Talents</h3>
				<p>At 9th level your focus on destructive power has strengthened your psionic talents. You can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage rolls of psionic talents you use.</p>
				<h3>Psychic Overload</h3>
				<p>By 14th level you have learned to push yourself past even the most sane of mental barriers. When you enter a trance using your psychic trance feature, you can choose to break your mind. When you do so, you gain additional trance points equal to your psi limit, and are considered to be focused on all psionic disciplines you know for the duration of the trance. When the trance ends, you gain one level of exhaustion.</p>
