				<strong><em>
					Mystics who dedicate themselves to the Order of the Awakened seek to unlock the full potential of the mind, capable of warping reality itself with the sheer force of their intellect. Taking little heed in preservation or sanctity, the Awakened probe ever deeper into the powers of psionics.
				</em></strong>
				<h3>Bonus Disciplines</h3>
				<p>You learn bonus disciplines associated with your order. When you select this order at 1st level and again at 10th level, choose a psionic discipline from the Order Disciplines table to learn. These disciplines do not count against the number of disciplines you can know.</p>

				<h3>Bonus Talent</h3>
				<p>Starting at 1st level when you choose this order, you learn one additional <a href="psionic_talents.html">Psionic Talent</a> of your choice. This talent does not count against the number of talents you can know.</p>
				<h3>Psyche Digestion</h3>
				<p>By 3rd level you've learned how to sacrifice portions of your mind for more power. As an action you disable an non-disabled psionic discipline you know and recover psi points equal to your psi limit, provided you have at least one discipline you can select. You cannot focus on nor spend psi points on a disabled discipline. If you are focused on or concentrating on a disabled discipline, that focus and/or concentration immediately ends.</p>
				<h3>Hardened Mind</h3>
				<p>At 6th level your rigid psychic exercises have strengthened your focus. Whenever you would fail a check to maintain concentration on one of your psionic disciplines, you can choose to succeed instead. Once you use this feature you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>
				<h3>Psychic Overload</h3>
				<p>By 14th level you have learned to maximize your destructive potential. When you roll for damage using a psionic discipline, you can choose to deal the maximum damage for that roll instead of rolling. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
