			<h2 id="delusion">Delusion</h2>
			<p>As an action, you instill a false sensory experience in the mind of a creature within 60 feet of you. You create a sound or an image of an object within 30 feet of the target that lasts for one minute and can only perceived by the target. The effect also ends if you dismiss it (no action required) or sue this talent again.</p>
			<p>If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.</p>
			<p>If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be false, because things can pass through it.</p>
			<p>If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is false with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your psionic save DC. If a creature discerns the effect for what it is, it ends for that creature.</p>

			<h2 id="false_ally">False Ally</h2>
			<p>As an action you instill a sense of friendship in a non-hostile creature you can see within 30 feet of you. For the one minute, you have advantage on all Charisma checks directed at the target. When the effect ends, the creature realizes that you used magic to influence its mood and becomes hostile toward you. A creature prone to violence might attack you. Another creature might seek retribution in other ways (at the DM's discretion), depending on the nature of your interaction with it.</p>

			<h2 id="mind_bolt">Mind Bolt</h2>
			<p>As an action you send a bolt of pure psionic energy towards a creature you can see within 90 feet of you. Make a ranged psionic attack roll against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.</p>
			<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> This talent's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach certain levels: 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).</p>

			<h2 id="psionic_hammer">Psionic Hammer</h2>
			<p>As an action you attempt to shove a creature you can see within 60 feet of you using psionic force. The target must succeed on an Strength saving throw or take 1d6 force damage, and if the creature is large or smaller, it is pushed up to 10 feet directly away from you.</p>
			<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> This talent's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels: 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p>

			<h2 id="psionic_whip">Psionic Whip</h2>
			<p>As an action you attempt to lash a creature you can see within 30 feet of you using psionic force. The target must succeed on an Strength saving throw or take 1d8 force damage, and if the creature is large or smaller, it is pulled up to 10 feet directly towards you.</p>
			<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> This talent's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach certain levels: 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>

			<h2 id="revelation">Revelation</h2>
			<p>As an action touch one willing creature, granting them insight into their future actions. The next time the target makes an ability check within the next minute, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the check. The effect then ends.</p>

			<h2 id="telekinesis">Telekinesis</h2>
			<p>As an action, you create an invisible psionic force at a point within 30 feet of you. The force lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no action required.) The force vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or you use this talent again</p>
			<p>You can use your action to control the force. You can use the force to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the force up to 30 feet each time you use it.</p>
			<p>The force can't attack, activate magical items, or carry more than 10 pounds.</p>

			<h2 id="thought_blade">Thought Blade</h2>
			<p>As a bonus action you infuse a melee weapon with psionic power. For the next minute, you can use your psionic ability instead of Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls using that weapon, the weapon's damage die becomes a d8 if it isn't already higher, and the weapon deals force damage instead of its normal damage. This effect ends if you use this talent again or let go of the weapon.</p>

			<h2 id="thought_spike">Thought Spike</h2>
			<p>As an action you drive a spike of disorientating psionic energy into the mind of a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage and subtract 1d4 from the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.</p>
			<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> This talent's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels: 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p>
