			<h2 id="mind_bolt">Mind Bolt</h2>
			<p>As an action you send a bolt of pure psionic energy towards a creature you can see within 90 feet of you. Make a ranged psionic attack roll against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.</p>
			<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> This talent's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach certain levels: 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).</p>

			<h2 id="psionic_hammer">Psionic Hammer</h2>
			<p>As an action you attempt to shove a creature you can see within 60 feet of you using psionic force. The target must succeed on an Strength saving throw or take 1d6 force damage, and if the creature is large or smaller, it is pushed up to 10 feet directly away from you.</p>
			<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> This talent's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels: 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p>

			<h2 id="revelation">Revelation</h2>
			<p>As an action touch one willing creature, granting them insight into their future actions. The next time the target makes an ability check within the next minute, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the check. The effect then ends.</p>

			<h2 id="telekinesis">Telekinesis</h2>
			<p>As an action, you create an invisible psionic force at a point within 30 feet of you. The force lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no action required.) The force vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or you use this talent again</p>
			<p>You can use your action to control the force. You can use the force to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the force up to 30 feet each time you use it.</p>
			<p>The force can't attack, activate magical items, or carry more than 10 pounds.</p>

			<h2 id="thought_blade">Thought Blade</h2>
			<p>As an action you make a melee weapon attack, provided you are holding a melee weapon you are proficient with. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects and is infused with psionic energy until the start of your next turn. If the creature targets you with an attack or spell before then, it takes 1d8 psychic damage and the effect ends.</p>
			<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 psychic damage to the target on a hit, and the damage the target takes for targetting you increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8 and 3d8) and again at 17th level (3d8 and 4d8).</p>

			<h2 id="thought_spike">Thought Spike</h2>
			<p>As an action you drive a spike of disorientating psionic energy into the mind of a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage and subtract 1d4 from the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.</p>
			<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> This talent's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels: 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p>
