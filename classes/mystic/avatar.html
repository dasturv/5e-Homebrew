				<strong><em>
					Mystics who dedicate themselves to the Order of the Avatar seek to master emotions. Tapping into the raw emotions that drive creatures, some seek dominion over others as manipulators and tyrants, and others seek to bring joy and purpose to the world.
				</em></strong>
				<h3>Bonus Disciplines</h3>
				<p>You learn bonus disciplines associated with your order. When you select this order at 1st level and again at 10th level, choose a psionic discipline from the Order Disciplines table to learn. These disciplines do not count against the number of disciplines you can know.</p>
