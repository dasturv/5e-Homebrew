				<strong><em>
					Mystics shun the world to turn their eyes inward, mastering the full potential of their minds and exploring their psyches before turning to face the world. Mystics are incredibly rare, and most prefer to keep the nature of their abilities secret. Using their inner, psychic strength, they can read minds, fade into invisibility, transform their bodies into living iron, and seize control of the physical world and bend it to their will.

				<li>studded leather armor</li>
				<li>(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon</li>

			</ul>
			<p>Alternatively, if you are using starting gold, you start with 4d4x10 gp.</p>
			<h3>Psionics</h3>
			<p>As a student of psionics, you can master and use psionic talents and disciplines. Psionics is a special form of magic use, distinct from spellcasting.</p>
			<h5>Psionic Talents</h5>
			<p>A psionic talent is a minor psionic effect you have mastered. At 1st level, you know one psionic talent of your choice. You learn additional talents of your choice at higher levels. The Talents Known column of the Mystic table shows the total number of talents you know at each level; when that number goes up for you, choose a new talent. You chose your talents from the <a href="#">Psionic Talents</a> list.</p>
			<h5>Psionic Disciplines</h5>
			<p>A psionic discipline is a rigid set of mental exercises that allows a mystic to manifest psionic power. A mystic masters only a few disciplines at a time, and choses them from the <a href="#">Psionic Discipline</a> list.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, you know one psionic discipline of your choice. The Disciplines Known column of the Mystic table shows the total number of disciplines you know at each level; when that number goes up for you, choose a new discipline.</p>
			<h5>Psi Points</h5>
			<p>You have an internal reservoir of energy that can be devoted to psionic disciplines you know. This energy is represented by your Psi points. Each psionic discipline describes effects you can create with it by spending psi points. A psionic talent requires no psi points.</p>
			<p>The number of psi points you have is based on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Points column of the Mystic table. Whenever you complete a long rest, you recover all expended psi points.</p>
			<h5>Psi Limit</h5>
			<p>Though you have access to a potent amount of psionic energy, it takes training and practice to channel that energy. There is a limit on the number of psi points you can spend on psionic discipline. The limit is based on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Limit column of the Mystic table. For example, as a 3rd-level mystic, you can spend no more than 3 psi points on a discipline each time you use it, no matter how many psi points you have.</p>
			<h5>Psychic Focus</h5>
			<p>You can focus psionic energy on one of your psionic disciplines to draw ongoing benefits from it. As an action, you can choose one of your psionic disciplines and gain its psychic focus benefit, which is detailed in that discipline’s description. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another action to choose a different focus benefit. You can only focus on one psionic discipline at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn’t limit your ability to use other disciplines.</p>
			<h5>Psionic Ability</h5>
			<p>Intelligence is your psionic ability for your psionic disciplines. You use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psionic discipline or when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<p><strong>Discipline save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
			<p><strong>Discipline attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
			<h3>Mystic Order</h3>
			<p>At 1st level, you choose a mystic order, showing your specific approach to psionics. The order you choose grants you features at 1st level and again at 3rd, 6th and 14th level.</p>
			<table class="content-table">

			<h3>Mystical Recovery</h3>
			<p>Starting at 2nd level, you've learned how to recover some of your spent psychic energy. As an action you can recover a number of spent psi points equal to half your mystic level (rounded down). Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
			<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
			<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
			<h3>Psychic Versatility</h3>
			<p>Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one Psionic Discipline you know with another available to you, as you shift the focus of your psionic practices.</p>
			<h3>Psychic Trance</h3>
			<p>Beginning at 5th level, you gain the ability to more deeply focus on your psionic disciplines. When you use an action to begin focusing on a psionic discipline, you can choose to enter a deep trance as part of that same action. The trance lasts for one minute or until you stop focusing on the selected discipline. When you enter the trance, you gain a number of special trance points equal to twice your psi limit. These points can be spent as psi points, but can only be spent on a focused discipline, and are lost when the trance ends. You can spend standard psi points as normal while in a trance.</p>
			<p>Additionally, your psi limit is increased by 2 for the purposes of calculating the maximum number of psi points you can spend on the focused discipline.</p>
			<p>You have one use of this feature, and regain all expended uses of it when you complete a long rest. You gain one additional use of this feature at 13th level.</p>
			<h3>Centering Mantra</h3>
			<p>Beginning at 7th level, your internal mantras and practices you use to focus reinforce your mental fortitude. You have advantage on concentration checks to maintain concentration on a psionic discipline you are focused on.</p>
			<h3>Potent Psionics</h3>
			<p>At 9th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon attacks with psychic energy. Once on each of your turns when you deal damage to a creature with a weapon or psionic talent, you can deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to that target.</p>
			<h3>Quickened Focus</h3>
			<p>By 10th level your experience entering in and out of your focused state has made it far easier. You can begin focusing on a psionic discipline as a bonus action instead of an action. You can also enter a trance using your Psychic Trance feature as part of this bonus action, provided you have at least one use left.</p>
			<h3>Psionic Body</h3>
			<p>Beginnning at 11th level, your psionic powers are so great they have infused your physical form. You are immune to poison and disease, and have resistance to poison damage.</p>
			<h3>Strength of Mind</h3>
			<p>At 15th level, your studies into psionics has brought you a deep understanding of how psionic energy can augment mind and body. This understanding has allowed you greater defenses. You gain proficiency with all saving throws.</p>
			<h3>Inner Discipline</h3>
			<p>At 18th level, you have practiced a particular mantra so much that focusing on it is second nature. Choose one psionic discipline you know. You are considered to be focused on that discipline at all times, and this discipline does not count against the number of psionic disciplines you can focus on at a time.</p>
			<h3>Psychic Ascension</h3>
			<p>By 20th level your psionic power is so potent that your weaker abilities don't drain you at all. You can use features of psionic disciplines you know without expending psi points, provided the psi point cost for that feature is less than or equal to one third of your psi limit (rounded down) for that discipline.</p>
