				<strong><em>
					Mystics shun the world to turn their eyes inward, mastering the full potential of their minds and exploring their psyches before turning to face the world. Mystics are incredibly rare, and most prefer to keep the nature of their abilities secret. Using their inner, psychic strength, they can read minds, fade into invisibility, transform their bodies into living iron, and seize control of the physical world and bend it to their will.

			<h3>Psionics</h3>
			<p>As a student of psionics, you can master and use psionic talents and disciplines. Psionics is a special form of magic use, distinct from spellcasting, made up of practices instead of spells. A psionic practice cannot be affected by abilities that target spells, such as <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:counterspell">Counterspell</a>, but are still affected by abilities that target magic in general, such as <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dispel-magic">Dispel Magic</a>.</p>
			
			<h5>Psionic Talents</h5>
			<p>A psionic talent is a minor psionic practice you have mastered. At 1st level, you know one psionic talent of your choice. You learn additional talents of your choice at higher levels. The Talents Known column of the Mystic table shows the total number of talents you know at each level; when that number goes up for you, choose a new talent. You chose your talents from the <a href="psionic_talents.html">Psionic Talents</a> list.</p>
			
			<h5>Psionic Disciplines</h5>
			<p>A psionic discipline is a rigid set of mental exercises that allows a mystic to manifest psionic power. A mystic masters only a few disciplines at a time, and choses them from the <a href="psionic_disciplines.html">Psionic Discipline</a> list.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, you know one psionic discipline of your choice. The Disciplines Known column of the Mystic table shows the total number of disciplines you know at each level; when that number goes up for you, choose a new discipline.</p>

			<h5>Psi Points</h5>
			<p>You have an internal reservoir of energy that can be devoted to psionic disciplines you know. This energy is represented by your Psi points. Each psionic discipline describes a list of practices you can create with it by spending psi points. A psionic talent requires no psi points.</p>
			<p>The number of psi points you have is based on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Points column of the Mystic table. Whenever you complete a long rest, you recover all expended psi points.</p>
			
			<h5>Psi Limit</h5>
			<p>Though you have access to a potent amount of psionic energy, it takes training and practice to channel that energy. There is a limit on the number of psi points you can spend on psionic practices each turn. The limit is based on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Limit column of the Mystic table. For example, as a 3rd-level mystic, you can spend no more than 3 psi points on practices each turn, no matter how many psi points you have.</p>
			
			<h5>Psychic Focus</h5>
			<p>You can focus psionic energy on one of your psionic disciplines to draw ongoing benefits from it. As an action, you can choose one of your psionic disciplines and gain its psychic focus benefit, which is detailed in that discipline’s description. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another action to choose a different focus benefit. You can only focus on one psionic discipline at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn’t limit your ability to use other discipline practices.</p>
			
			<h5>Psionic Restrictions</h5>
			<p>You cannot use psionic talents nor spend psi points on psionic practices while wearing armor or using a shield that you are not proficient with.</p>
			
			<h5>Psionic Ability</h5>
			<p>Intelligence is your psionic ability for your psionic practices. You use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psionic practice or when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<p><strong>Psionic save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
			<p><strong>Psionic attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
			
			<h3>Mystic Order</h3>
			<p>At 1st level, you choose a mystic order, showing your specific approach to psionics. The order you choose grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 9th and 14th level.</p>
			<table class="content-table">

			<h3>Mystical Recovery</h3>
			<p>Starting at 2nd level, you've learned how to recover some of your spent psychic energy. As an action you can recover a number of spent psi points equal to your proficiency bonus. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
			
			<h3>Telepathy</h3>
			<p>At 2nd level, your mind awakens to the ability to communicate via telepathy. You can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 90 feet of you in this manner. You don’t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic messages, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language or be telepathic itself.</p>
			
			<h3>Strength of Mind</h3>
			<p>By 3rd level, your meditations on the body, mind and soul have taught you how to be more flexible with how you protect yourself. Whenever you complete a long rest, you can replace your proficiency with Wisdom saving throws with proficiency in Strength, Dexterity, Constitution or Charisma saving throws. This effect lasts until you complete your next long rest.</p>

			<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
			<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
			
			<h3>Psychic Versatility</h3>
			<p>Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one Psionic Discipline you know with another available to you, as you shift the focus of your psionic practices.</p>
			<p>Additionally, you can replace one Psionic Talent you know with another available to you.</p>
			
			<h3>Psychic Trance</h3>
			<p>Beginning at 5th level, you gain the ability to more deeply focus on your psionic disciplines. As a bonus action while you are focused on a psionic discipline, you can enter a deep trance. The trance lasts for one minute or until you stop focusing on the selected discipline. When you enter the trance, you gain a number of special trance points equal to your psi limit. These points can be spent as psi points, but can only be spent on a focused discipline's practices, and are lost when the trance ends. You can spend standard psi points as normal while in a trance.</p>
			<p>Additionally, your psi limit is increased by 2 for the purposes of calculating the maximum number of psi points you can spend on the focused discipline's practices each turn. For example, if a 3rd-level mystic had entered a trance while focused on the <a href="psionic_disciplines.html#psychic_assault">Psychic Assault</a> discipline, and had spent 2 psi points already this turn, they can spend up to 3 psi points on a Psychic Assault practice, or only 1 psi point on an un-focused discipline's practice.</p>
			<p>You have two used of this feature, and regain all expended uses of it when you complete a long rest. You gain one additional use of this feature at 13th level and another at 18th level. You cannot use this feature while already in a trance.</p>
			
			<h3>Centering Mantra</h3>
			<p>Beginning at 7th level, your internal mantras and practices you use to focus reinforce your mental fortitude. You have advantage on concentration checks to maintain concentration on practices for a psionic discipline you are focused on.</p>
			
			<h3>Mental Flexibility</h3>
			<p>Starting at 10th level, changing your focus has become far easier. You can focus on a psionic discipline as a bonus action instead of an action.</p>
			
			<h3>Psychic Reabsorption</h3>
			<p>Beginnning at 11th level, you have learned to reabsorb unused psychic power instead of having it go to waste. When you leave a trance from your psychic trance feature, you recover a number of spent psi points equal to one half the number of unspent trance points you have (rounded down).</p>
			
			<h3>Master of the Mind</h3>
			<p>At 15th level, your psionic defenses have been enhanced. You gain proficiency with Charisma saving throws. Additionally, whenever you complete a long rest, you can replace your proficiency with Charisma saving throws with proficiency in Strength, Dexterity, Constitution or Wisdom saving throws. This effect lasts until you complete your next long rest.</p>
			
			<h3>Psionic Body</h3>
			<p>Upon reaching 17th level your mental image of yourself has become so complete, your body cannot be changed. You no longer age. In addition, you are immune to effects that would alter your form against your will, such as the <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:polymorph">Polymorph</a> spell.</p>

			<h3>Inner Discipline</h3>
			<p>At 18th level, you have practiced a particular mantra so much that focusing on it is second nature. Choose one psionic discipline you know. You are considered to be focused on that discipline at all times, and this discipline does not count against the number of psionic disciplines you can focus on at a time.</p>
			
			<h3>Psychic Ascension</h3>
			<p>By 20th level your psionic power is so potent that your weaker abilities don't drain you at all. Whenever you would expend two or fewer psi points on a psionic practice, you instead don't expend any psi points.</p>
