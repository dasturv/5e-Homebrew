				Scholar: Politician
			</div>
			<p>
				<strong><em>
					For some, influencing others is far more science than art, and this rings true more than ever for scholars of the Politician pursuit. Such scholars seek to master all ways to get others to do as they please, through flattery, charm, insults and intimidation. Whether beguiling ally or venomous foe, a scholar of the Politician pursuit is a potent force.
				</em></strong>

				<h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3>
				<p>When you choose this pursuit at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Deception, History, Insight, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion.</p>
				<p>Additionally, you gain proficiency with Calligrapher's Tools and learn two languages of your choice.</p>
				
				<h3>Insightful Analysis</h3>
				<p>Also at 3rd level, a creature under the effects of your Critical Analysis feature has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws against your maneuvers.</p>
				
				<h3>Beguiling Presence</h3>
				<p>At 6th level your confidence make your foes wary to attack you. Attack rolls made against you are made at disadvantage. If you take damage, this feature ceases until the start of your next turn. Additionally, this feature ceases while you are incapacitated, frightened or surrounded.</p>

				<h3>Inspirational Support</h3>
				<p>Beginning at 10th level, whenever another creature would add one or more of your superiority dice to an ability check, attack roll or saving throw, they can roll one of those dice twice and keep either roll.</p>
				
				<h3>Broad Appeal</h3>
				<p>By 17th level, your words are all but infectious. Whenever you use a maneuver that requires a target to make a Wisdom saving throw, you can choose an additional creature within 30 feet of you. That creature must also make the Wisdom saving throw, and is effected as if it was the target of the maneuver if it fails. The second creature does not take any damage from the maneuver.</p>
