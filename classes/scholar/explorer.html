				<strong><em>
					For some scholars, study in stuffy classrooms and claustrophobic lecture halls are the stuff of nightmares. Such scholars take their research out into the world, to far off lands, ancient ruins and unknown cultures. Known as Explorers, these scholars firmly believe that the best place to learn is outside of classrooms and colleges, out where things actually happen.

				<h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3>
				<p>When you choose this pursuit at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Nature, Perception, Stealth, Survival.</p>
				<p>Additionally, you gain proficiency with Cartographer's Tools and Herbalism kits.</p>
				
				<h3>Ready for Anything</h3>
				<p>Also at 3rd level, you have advantage on Initiative rolls. Additionally, you cannot be surprised while you are conscious.</p>
				
				<h3>Evasion</h3>
				<p>Beginning at 6th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an Ice Storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>
				
				<h3>Avid Traveller</h3>
				<p>Starting at 10th level, your movement speed increases by 10 feet. Furthermore, you gain a climb speed and swim speed equal to your walk speed.</p>
				
				<h3>Seen It All</h3>
				<p>By 17th level, your experience out in the field is so great, that you've effectively seen it all. You are immune to the frightened condition. Additionally, whenever you make an attack roll against a creature or hit a creature with an attack, you can treat that creature as if it was analyzed by your Critical Analysis feature for that attack roll or hit.</p>
