			<p>
				<strong><em>
					Masters of invention, artificers use ingenuity and magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in objects. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions. You can find everything you need to play one of these inventors in the next few sections.
				</em></strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong><em>
					Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce the right tool for a job as well as an artificer.
				</em></strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>
					You must have a Intelligence score of 13 or higher in order to multiclass in or out of this class.

			<h1>Class Features</h1>
			<p>As an artificer you gain the following class features.</p>
			<h5>Hit Points</h5>
			<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per artificer level
			<br><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier
			<br><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifer per artificer level after 1st</p>
			<h5>Proficiencies</h5>
			<p><strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor, medium armor, shields
			<br><strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons
			<br><strong>Tools:</strong> Thieves’ tools, tinker’s tools, two type of artisan’s tools of your choice
			<br><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Constitution, Intelligence
			<br><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Sleight of Hand</p>
			<h5>Equipment</h5>
			<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>any two simple weapons</li>
				<li>a light crossbow and 20 bolts</li>
				<li>(a) studded leather armor or (b) scale mail</li>
				<li>thieves’ tools and a dungeoneer’s pack</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Alternatively, if you are using starting gold, you start with 5d4x10 gp.</p>

			<h3>Infuse Item</h3>
			<p>Starting at 1st level, you've gained the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions, turning those objects into magic items.</p>

			<h5>Infusions Known</h5>
			<p>When you gain this feature, pick three <a href="infusions.html">artificer infusions</a> to learn. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.</p>
			<p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.</p>

			<h5>Infusing an Item</h5>
			<p>Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion's description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see the attunement rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide).</p>
			<p>Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you replace your knowledge of the infusion.</p>
			<p>You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion ends, and then the new infusion applies.</p>
			<p>If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.</p>

			<h3>Arcane Tinker</h3>
			<p>Also beginning at 1st level you learn the <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mending">Mending</a> cantrip, as well as the spells <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-magic">Detect Magic</a> and <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:identify">Identify</a>. You can cast these spells as rituals and can use a set of artisan tools you are proficient with as a spellcasting focus for them. They are artificer spells for you. These spells do not count against the number of cantrips you can know nor the number of spells you can prepare, and you are considered to always have them prepared.</p>
			<p>Additionally, the time it would take you to craft a magic item is halved, provided you are proficient with appropriate artisan's tools.</p>

			<h3>Spellcasting</h3>
			<p>Starting at 2nd level, you've studied the workings of magic and how to cast spells, channeling the magic through objects. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you appear to produce wonders from mundane items and outlandish inventions.</p>

			<h5>Cantrips</h5>
			<p>At 2nd level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:artificer">artificer spell list</a>. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>

			<h5>Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>
			<p>The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p>You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:artificer">artificer spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<p>For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:cure-wounds">Cure Wounds</a>, you can cast it using a lst-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
			<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>

			<div class="optional">
				<p>In addition to the list above, artificers can also prepare the <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:healing-spirit">Healing Spirit</a> spell, provided they can prepare 2nd level spells.</p>
			</div>

			<h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>
			<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
			<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

			<h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5>
			<p>You must use either tinker's tools, a set of artisan's tools you are proficient with, or an item bearing one of your Infusions as the spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.</p>

			<h3>Tinker's Insight</h3>
			<p>Also at 2nd level your studies into artifice allows you to bypass normal item restrictions. You can attune to and use magic items regardless of any alignment, class or racial requirements.</p>
			<p>Additionally, if a magic item you are using has a save DC, you can use your artificer spell save DC instead.</p>

			<h3>Arcane Recharge</h3>
			<p>Starting at 3rd level, over the course of a short rest you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than one third of your artificer level (rounded down). Once you use this feature you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, you can use this feature to cause on Infused item or magic item you touch to regain any charges it would normally regain at dawn, in place of recovering spell slots.</p>

			<h3>Artificer Specialization</h3>
			<p>At 3rd level, you choose the type of specialization you pursue. Your choice grants you features at 5th level and again at 9th and 15th level.</p>
			<table class="content-table">

			</table>
			<h5>Specialization Spells</h5>
			<p>Each specialization has a list of spells-its specialization spells that you gain at the artificer levels noted in the specialization description. Once you gain a specialization spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>
			<p>If you have a specialization spell that doesn't appear on the artificer spell list, the spell is nonetheless an artificer spell for you.</p>

			<h3>Ability Score Increase</h3>
			<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>

			<h3>Cantrip Versatility</h3>
			<p>Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:artificer">artificer spell list</a>.</p>

			<h3>Flash of Genius</h3>
			<p>By 6th level you've gained the ability to come up with solutions under pressure. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.</p>
			<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

			<h3>Expert Tinkerer</h3>
			<p>At 7th level, your proficiency bonus is now doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.</p>
			<p>Additionally, your expertise in arcane tinkering allows you to infuse magic items with Infusions, provided either the infusion or magic item does not require attunement. If both the magic item and the infusion grants a bonus to attack rolls or spell save DCs, you choose which bonus to use. You can still only have one infusion applied to each object.</p>

			<h3>Magic Item Mastery</h3>
			<p>When you reach 10th level, you achieve a profound understanding of how to use and make magic items. You can attune to up to four magic items at once.</p>
			<p>The number of magic items you can attune to at one time increases again at 14th level (5) and 18th level (6).</p>

			<h3>Soul of Artifice</h3>
			<p>At 20th level, you develop a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for protection:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are currently attuned to.</li>
				<li>If you're reduced to 0 hit points but not killed out-right, you can use your reaction to end one of your artificer infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead of 0.</li>
			</ul>
