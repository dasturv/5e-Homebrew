				<strong><em>
					Information is a powerful thing, though hard to collect and store. For ages, song and stories held knowledge, then it was books and scrolls, but the first Archivists imagined something even greater: storing information within an artificial mind. What library could match a psychic archive capable of accessing, sorting and storing information in seconds? Archivists are those on the cutting edge of magical science, masters of creating artificial intelligences fueled by magic.

				<h3>Tool Proficiency</h3>
				<p>When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with calligrapher's supplies. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.</p>

				<h3>Artificial Mind</h3>
				<p>Starting at 3rd level, you discover how to awaken an intelligence within an object. Whenever you complete a long rest while you have access to your calligrapher's supplies (or other applicable artisan tool), you can magically rouse a keen mind within a tiny, nonmagical object. While instilled with the mind, the object is magical and you can use it as a spellcasting focus. If you already have an artificial mind created using this feature, the first one immediately dissipates. The magic item has the following properties:</p>
				
				<p><strong>Telepathic Advisor</strong><br>
					The artificial mind telepathically supplies you with advice and information on certain topics. When you complete a long rest or create a new artificial mind, you may choose two skills from the following list: Animal Handling, Arcana, Deception, History, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Performance, Persuasion or Religion. While the mind is on your person you have proficiency with the chosen skills.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Manifest Mind</strong><br>
					As a bonus action while the magic item is on your person, you can cause the mind to manifest as a tiny spectral presence, hovering in an unoccupied space of your choice within 60 feet of you. This presence is intangible and invulnerable, though it vanishes if affected by an effect that dispels magic, it is ever greater than 300 feet from you or its magic item, or you use a bonus action to dismiss it. The presence sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius, and you determine the presence's appearance. While manifested the artificial mind can hear and see, and has darkvision with a range of 60 feet. While manifested, the mind is telepathically linked to you, allowing you to use its senses. You can see and hear what the presence sees and hears in addition to your own senses.
					As a bonus action on your turn you can cause the presence to move up to 30 feet in any direction. It can hover and pass through creatures, but not objects.
				</p>

				<h3>Information Overload</h3>
				<p>Also at 3rd level, you gain the ability to psychically overload and distract your opponents. As a bonus action while your artificial mind is on your person, you can force a creature you can see within 90 feet of you to make an intelligence saving throw. On a failed save the target takes 1d8 psychic damage and the next attack roll made against it before the end of your next turn has advantage.</p>
				<p>This damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 9th level (3d8) and 15th level (4d8).

				<h3>Mind Network</h3>
				<p>At 5th level your knowledge on minds has unlocked new potential options to both communicate and harm. You gain the following bonuses:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>While your artificial mind is on your person, you can communicate telepathically with anyone carrying an item bearing one of your artificer infusions. That person can also communicate telepathically with you as long as they have that item. This communication can occur over any distance, but only while the creature is on the same plane of existence as you.</li>
					<li>Whenever you deal psychic damage with an artificer spell or your Information Overload feature, you deal additional psychic damage equal to your intelligence modifier.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Empowered Mind</h3>
				<p>Starting at 9th level, you are able to pour even more magical potency into your artificial mind. You gain the following features:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>While your artificial mind is manifested, you may cast artificer spells and use your Information Overload feature as if you were in the presence's space using its senses.</li>
					<li>When you select the skills for your Telepathic Advisor feature, you may select three skills from the list instead of two.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>Pure Information</h3>
				<p>By 15th level you are capable of using your artificial mind to tranform yourself into pure information. As an action while your artificial mind is on your person you can teleport to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of your manifested mind, an item bearing one of your infusions or a creature holding an item bearing one of your infusions. Once you use this feature you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
