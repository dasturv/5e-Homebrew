				<h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3>
				<p>When you choose this pursuit at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, History, Intimidation, and Perception.</p>
				<p>Additionally, you gain proficiency with shields and martial weapons.</p>
				<h3>Fighting Style</h3>
				<p>Also at 3rd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if later you get to choose again.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Archery (PHB).</strong> You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</li>
				</ul><ul>
					<li><strong>Blind Fighting (TCE).</strong> You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.</li>
				</ul><ul>
					<li><strong>Defense (PHB).</strong> While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</li>
				</ul><ul>
					<li><strong>Dueling (PHB).</strong> When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</li>
				</ul><ul>
					<li><strong>Interception (TCE).</strong> When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.</li>
				</ul><ul>
					<li><strong>Protection (PHB).</strong> When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.</li>
				</ul><ul>
					<li><strong>Thrown Weapon Fighting (TCE).</strong>You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
						<ul>
							<li>In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul><ul>
					<li><strong>Close Quarters Shooter (UA).</strong> When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. You have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Extra Attack</h3>
				<p>Beginning at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>
				<h3>Battlefield Commander</h3>
				<p>Starting at 10th level, your battlefield cunning runs so deep that your allies serve as extensions of yourself. Whenever a willing creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll or hits a target with an attack, you can use your reaction to apply one of your known maneuvers to that attack roll or hit as if you made that attack roll or hit that target. You expend superiority dice as normal for this maneuver.</p>
				<h3>Coordinated Strike</h3>
				<p>By 17th level, your tactical genius is without peer. As an action, you can issue a series of commands. Choose a number of allies who can hear and understand you, up to your Intelligence modifier. Each of those creatures can use their reaction to do one of the following:</p>
				<ul><li>The creature moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</li></ul>
				<ul><li>The creature makes a weapon attack with advantage on the attack roll.</li></ul>
				<ul><li>The creature gains 10 temporary hit points and attacks against it have disadvantage until the start of your next turn.</li></ul>
				<p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
