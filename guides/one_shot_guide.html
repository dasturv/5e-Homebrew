				Guide: Making a One-Shot
			</div>
			<p><em>A one-shot is a self enclosed adventure that, despite the name, usually takes one to three sessions (any more than that and I'd recommend checking out my guide on <a href="campaign_guide">Making a Campaign.</a>) One-shots provide a lower commitment for dungeon masters to playtest ideas and gain experience, and players the ability to try out new character options and learn the system. Though, despite the lower stakes, one-shots can still be intensely fun and well thought out. This guide will walk you through my process, as well as provide some examples for inspiration.</em></p>
			<h3>Developing Your Concept</h3>
			<p>Before you start building encounters and get your players started on character creation, you need a concept. Your concept is effectively your mission statement for the one-shot combined with the hooks and limitations for your players. A concept consists of a target player experience, themes and setting.</p>

			<h5>Target Player Experience</h5>
			<p>The first (and in my opinion, most important) step in developing your concept is deciding on what your target player experience is. This may sound pretty big and complex, but at the end of the day, it is simply what sort of emotions you are trying to evoke in your players. While not every moment of your one-shot will follow this targeted experience, it is important to keep in mind as it is easy to undercut your own plans by throwing in an emotionally dissonant moment, breaking you carefully crafted experience. This decision is your guiding light for all your later decisions. The table below lists some potential options for target player experiences. You can choose one from the table below or make up your own.</p>
			<table class="content-table">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Player Experiences</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><em>I want my players to feel clever, like they are using their wits to overcome obstacles.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><em>I want my players to feel afraid, like they don't know what is happening and that they are in danger.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><em>I want my players to feel heroic, like they are righteous forces, saving the world.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><em>I want my players to feel small, like they are just another person in a world far larger than any of them.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><em>I want my players to feel conflicted, like they are no good choices, only less evil ones.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><em>I want my players to feel resolute, like they overcame their foes through tenacity and resolve.</em></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<h5>Themes</h5>
			<p>Next step to developing your concept is figuring what theme (or themes) you want to explore. A theme is a general idea that guides you, though unlike the target player experience, it is more focused on the actual world and story you want to tell. Themes can be a bit hard to wrap your head around initially, but one way to think of them is as a more concrete version of your target experience. Below is a table of potential themes you can explore, or you can make your own.</p>
			<table class="content-table">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th colspan="2">Themes</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><em>An Unfeeling Cosmos</em></td>
						<td><em>Crime and Punishment</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><em>Corrupt Government</em></td>
						<td><em>Dangers of Science/Magic</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><em>Freedom Versus Stability</em></td>
						<td><em>Growing Up</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><em>Relationships between Gods and Mortals</em></td>
						<td><em>Self Sacrifice</em></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<h5>Setting</h5>
			<p>Finally, to complete your concept, you need to choose what setting you want your one-shot to take place in. You can use a premade setting such as the Forgotten Realms, you can use a setting your table uses or you can always make something new. Of course, a one-shot won't be spanning a whole world, it needs a bit narrowing down. Choose a region or city in the setting you chose, once again keeping your target experience and themes in mind (it would be pretty hard to run a one-shot based around courtly intrigue in the middle of a frozen waste.)</p>
			<p>Your setting dictates what races and classes your players have access to, and your themes offer hooks to your players so they can help maintain the target experience. At this point you can decide what levels you want your players to be and send them off to build their characters.</p>
			
			<h3>Creating a Story</h3>
			<p>Once you have developed a concept and collected up your player's characters, you can move on to designing the framework for the one-shot itself. This is pretty much the same as writing a story, and will follow a similar process. I tend to follow a goal, conflict, complication model, as shown below.</p>
			
			<h5>Goal</h5>
			<p>Every story arc needs a goal, something that drives the party through obstacles, when turning back would be safer and easier. While it is not necessary for each member in a party to have the exact same goal, it is far simpler for them to share goals for a one-shot (you have far less time to devote towards inter-party conflict in one session.) Some potential goals may include: surviving a dangerous locale, getting paid by a patron, saving a defenseless village, solving a crime, and defeating a hated foe.</p>
			
			<h5>Conflict</h5>
			<p>A conflict is something that stands in the way of the party just completing their goal risk free. It is what turns a simple ability check into a threatening situation. Some examples of a conflict are: the temple housing the party's target is rigged with traps and constructs, the sea the party is sailing through is infested with monsters, the party is being pursued by a hostile group, and a village the party is in is being attacked by raiders.</p>
			
			<h5>Complication</h5>
			<p>Finally, a complication is some unknown factor that throws a wrench into the party's plans sometime in the story. While completely optional, throwing in a complication keeps the party on their toes and prevents a conflict from being resolved too early. Of course, if your party knows you well, sometimes the biggest complication can be none at all. Some examples of complications are: a third party is also seeking the same treasure, an unaware ally of the party is working with a rival group, a section of the dungeon is completely different than the provided map, someone else got to the target first.</p>

			<h3>Building the One-Shot</h3>
			<p>You should now have the concept and story framework for your one-shot, and now you can begin fleshing it out.</p>

			<h5>The Hook</h5>
			<p>The players can't go on your adventure if they don't know about it. The hook is the party's introduction to the goal you created, getting them invested and set off in the direction you intended. Below are some examples for plot hooks.</p>
			<table class="content-table">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Plot Hooks</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><em>A trusted ally approaches the party, asking for help.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><em>A patron offers a large sum of gold for the party to complete a task.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><em>The party finds a strange note or hears an intriguing rumor.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><em>A hated rival of the party starts preparing for something, and the party doesn't know what for.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><em>A party member recieves a mysterious vision or dream.</em></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><em>The party is detained and escape at the location of the plot.</em></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<h5>The Path</h5>
			<p>Once the players get started on the adventure proper, you need to have an idea of how they get from point A to point B, as well as what happens between them. Think of what story beats you'd like to touch on, what parts of the environment you'd like to highlight, and how and when the encounters will occur.</p>

			<h5>The Encounters</h5>
			<p>Encounters are the moments when the one-shot switches from narration to gameplay. This doesn't always mean combat, as traps and puzzles require just as much planning as a group of monsters. Designing encounters is a complex process. In order to design them I recommend checking out my guide on <a href="encounter_guide.html">Making Encounters.</a> Remember to think about your conflict, complication and target player experience while you design your encounters, and I'd try to limit yourself to 2-3 encounters for a party of four, for the sake of time.</p>

			<h5>The Characters</h5>
			<p>Sometimes you don't just want a mass of faceless monsters or static screaming villagers for your one-shot, sometimes you want to add some... character. For the purposes of one-shots especially, less is more when it comes to NPCs, as you have very limited time for your players to engage with and get attached to them. To make NPCs, I recommend checking out my guide on <a href="npc_guide.html">Making NPCs.</a></p>

			<h5>The Ending</h5>
			<p>While usually quite simple, it is a good idea to have a way to neatly tie the story to a close after the last roll. Perhaps the party simply returns back home, gets paid and rests. Maybe they bring the antagonist in to the authorities. No matter how you do it, it's always nice to have some closure at the end.</p>

			<h3>Running the One-Shot</h3>
			<p>By this point you've built everything you need to run the session, but now you have to actually run it. The following are some tips I have for running a session, and one-shots specifically.</p>

			<h5>Get to the Action</h5>
			<p>One-shots are, by their nature, on a time limit. Spending hours painting the scene and getting the players attached to your NPCs means little if you have to call it a day before any actual story happens. Get the party moving towards the plot as soon as possible, less you be fighting against time itself.</p>

			<h5>Stay Flexible</h5>
			<p>Even the most seasoned Dungeon Masters with the most loyal and predictable parties can't predict everything. Your players can and will do something you didn't think of, and when they do you may need to pivot. Learning how to improvise a path back towards your plot takes practice, but it's better to be flexible and secretly get them back on track than to railroad them (and when you get good enough, they won't even know.)</p>

			<h5>Give Yourself Grace</h5>
			<p>One-shots are a great place to practice and learn. You will make mistakes, and feel like you did a poor job, but remember that every Dungeon Master starts there, and you are your own worst critic. If you notice you did something wrong, that means you know enough to fix it, next time.</p>

			<h5>Focus on the Experience</h5>
			<p>No matter how wildly off course the one-shot gets, no matter how punishing the dice roll, no matter how many times you need to improvise, always remeber you already made a guiding light to keep things in line. Focus on your target player experience, it serves as a life saver in the tumultuous sea of running a session.</p>

			<h3>Final Tips</h3>
			<p>The following are some tips to consider throughout the process of making and running a one-shot.</p>

			<h5>Take Risks</h5>
			<p>The low stakes environment of one-shots allows you to do some riskier things than if you were running a campaign. Try out some strange mechanics or classes, test out new genres or settings, and make some weird encounters.</p>

			<h5>The End is the End</h5>
			<p>When you pull off a great one-shot, and everyone at the end is excited, it is all to easy to think "let's turn this into a campaign!" This is a trap. The steps to prepare for a campaign and a one-shot are fundamentally different, and hopping from a one-shot directly into a campaign will leave you and the players scrambling to try and turn a self enclosed story into a series (there is a reason why a sequel after a successful movie never hits quite the same.) Instead, consider if you have the capacity to run a campaign, and if so begin to build one in that setting, using the same or similar themes and target experiences as the one-shot.
