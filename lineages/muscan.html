				Muscan (Flies)
			</div>
			<em>The buzzing was maddening as Fyrn was dragged into the town bound in vines and rope. Leering faces peered at him from around every corner, with the scents and sights of rot overwhelming his senses. "So this is it?" he whispered to himself as he was pulled further into Maggotmaw...</em>
			<br><br>

			<h3>Foul Spawning</h3>
			<p>The Muscans are a relatively new race of bugfolk, being created by the fell god Maghorne. Their very nature is shaped by the foul diety's nature, and it is believed that each form the Muscans take represents a specific aspect of their creator. Each and every Muscan has some combination of respect and fear for their god, as he is a fickle being who will just as quickly eat his worshippers as reward them.</p>

			<h3>Cruel Castes</h3>
			<p>Muscan culture is completely defined by the form a muscan takes upon birth. The first caste is made up of the Bloated Muscans, the foul nobility and priests of their society, being the largest and strongest of their kin. In the second caste there are the Hungering Muscans, fast and aggressive Muscans who serve their god as warriors and assassins. The third caste are the Pitiful Muscans. Tiny but plentiful, they are seen as barely more than animals by the other castes.</p>

			<h3>Slaves and Sacrifices</h3>
			<p>Muscans living in their corrupted culture view all other species, sentient or not, as potential slaves or feed for their ever ravenous god. They seek out slaves aggressively, especially the Pitiful Muscans, as they know if Maghorne is not fed, it will be them who are used to sate his appetite instead. Life as a slave to the Muscans is brutal, cruel and short, always ending with being thrown into the gaping maw of their god.</p>

			<h3>Spreading Pestilence</h3>
			<p>The Muscan race is found in large quantities only within the confines of the Dreadmoor, the twisted remains of what once to be a grand jungle, corrupted and fed upon by Maghorne during his ascension to godhood. The legions of the Dawnkeeper Order keep the Muscans from breaking out of their stronghold and spreading their god's influence further, though individuals and small groups do occasionally sneak past to wreak havoc in the world at large.</p>

			<h3>Muscan Names</h3>
			<p>A Muscan's name is highly dependent on their status and form. Bloated and Hungering Muscans tend to have guttural names, with more important Muscans boasting longer and more complex names. Pitiful Muscans, if given a name at all, often have demeaning names that show their place in scoiety.</p>
			<p><strong>Greater Names:</strong> Bolukor, Doguk, Gorguk, Jhokul, Korebul, Mokug, Rogumal, Worgak <br>
			<strong>Pitiful Names:</strong> Burden, Corpse, Fodder, Lacking, Meat, Nothing, Serf, Worthless <br>
			<h3>Muscan Traits</h3>
			<p><em><strong>Regardless of what form they take, all Muscans share the following traits.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.</li>
				<li><strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are an insectoid.</li>
				<li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 30 sprigs.</li>
				<li><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 60 sprigs of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.</li>

				<li><strong>Subrace.</strong> You choose a subrace and gain its features. Choose either Hungering or Pitiful.</li>

			</ul>
			<h5>Hungering Muscan</h5>
			<p><em><strong>The hungering Muscans make up the second caste of their society, and emulate Maghorne's endless appetite. They are quick, lean and starved creatures with a long stabbing proboscis. They attack and drain the life giving fluids of creatures they think they can take, gaining power as they feed on others.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>

				<li><strong>Aggressive.</strong> You can take the dash action as a bonus action. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</li></li>
				<li><strong>Proboscis.</strong> Your sharp proboscis is a natural weapon, which counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient. You add your Constitution modifier, instead of your Strength modifier, to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with this proboscis. It deals 1d4 piercing damage on a hit. While you are missing half or more of your hit points, you have advantage on attack rolls you make with this bite.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>When you attack with this proboscis and hit a creature that isn't a Construct or Undead, you can empower yourself in one of the following ways of your choice:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>You regain hit points equal to the piercing damage dealt by the proboscis.</li>
						<li>You gain a bonus to the next ability check or attack roll you make; the bonus equals the piercing damage dealt by the proboscis.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>You can empower youself with this proboscis a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<h5>Pitiful Muscan</h5>
			<p><em><strong>The pitiful Muscans are the least of their kind, making up the third and lowest caste in their society, barely above the slaves and beasts according to their larger kin. The pitiful Muscans represent their creator's virulence, reproducing quickly and spreading wide. Small and cowardly, they live harsh and often short lives.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is small. Pitiful Muscans are usually aruond 3 sprigs tall and weight around 40 pebblets.</li>
				<li><strong>Fury of the Small.</strong> When you damage a creature with an attack or a spell and the creatureâ€™s size is larger than yours, you can cause the attack or spell to deal extra damage to the creature. The extra damage equals your proficiency bonus.</li>
				<ul><li>You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest, and you can use it no more than once per turn.</li></ul>
				<li><strong>Nimble Escape.</strong> You can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of your turns.</li>
