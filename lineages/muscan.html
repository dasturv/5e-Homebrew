			<h3>Llorelan</h3>
			<p><em><strong>The accursed spawn of the foul god Maghorne, the muscans live in a harsh society rife with violence and stratification. Split amongst three castes, each one representing one of the aspects off their fell creator, the Muscans squabble and fight amongst themselves near constantly. The Muscans are mistrustred and hated by all others, and the few who escape their harsh society face constant discrimination and even violence amongst the other races.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>

				<li><strong>Subrace.</strong> You choose a subrace and gain its features. Choose either Hungering or Pitiful.</li>
				<li><strong>Languages.</strong> Your character can speak, read and write Click-clack and Muscan. Muscan is a grating language with rough consonants and punctuated with harsh buzzing.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Hungering Muscan</h5>
			<p><em><strong>The hungering Muscans make up the second caste of their society, and emulate Maghorne's endless appetite. They are quick, lean and starved creatures with a long stabbing proboscis. They attack and drain the life giving fluids of creatures they think they can take, gaining power as they feed on others.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is medium.</li>
				<li><strong>Quick.</strong> Your walking speed increases to 35 feet, and your flying increases to 30 feet.</li>
				<li><strong>Proboscis.</strong> Your sharp proboscis is a natural weapon, which counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient. You add your Constitution modifier, instead of your Strength modifier, to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with this proboscis. It deals 1d4 piercing damage on a hit. While you are missing half or more of your hit points, you have advantage on attack rolls you make with this bite.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>When you attack with this proboscis and hit a creature that isn't a Construct or Undead, you can empower yourself in one of the following ways of your choice:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>You regain hit points equal to the piercing damage dealt by the proboscis.</li>
						<li>You gain a bonus to the next ability check or attack roll you make; the bonus equals the piercing damage dealt by the proboscis.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>You can empower youself with this proboscis a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<h5>Pitiful Muscan</h5>
			<p><em><strong>The pitiful Muscans are the least of their kind, making up the third and lowest caste in their society, barely above the slaves and beasts according to their larger kin. The pitiful Muscans represent their creator's virulence, reproducing quickly and spreading wide. Small and cowardly, they live harsh and often short lives.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is small.</li>
				<li><strong>Fury of the Small.</strong> When you damage a creature with an attack or a spell and the creatureâ€™s size is larger than yours, you can cause the attack or spell to deal extra damage to the creature. The extra damage equals your proficiency bonus.</li>
				<ul><li>You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest, and you can use it no more than once per turn.</li></ul>
				<li><strong>Nimble Escape.</strong> You can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of your turns.</li>
