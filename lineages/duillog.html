				Duillog (Leaf Insects)
			</div>
			<em>Tok had no idea he was surrounded until dozens of arrowheads were pointed at him. He froze, his arms slowly rising as one of his captures spoke. "You're pretty far from your home, Elytran," the lean warrior hissed, "Don't you know not to wander in these woods?" Tok tried hard to steel his nerves. He had found the Duillog he was looking for, but now how to convince them not to kill him...</em>

			<h3>Ancient Devotees</h3>
			<p>The Duillog do not claim to be descended from any diety. Instead, they pay homage to the Gashalag, the embodiment of the natural order and the entire world. According the Duillog, all life comes from this primordial force, even the gods. The Duillog carefully watch the world around them for signs and messages from the Gashalag, interpreting its will in order to be its hands in the realm of mortals. The Duillog are considered to be some of the first druids and rangers in the world of Llorelan.</p>

			<h3>Hidden Lords</h3>
			<p>In ancient times, it was the Duillog who ruled the great forests of the Westlands. When the Vespids rose to power, claiming the great trees for themsleves, there was no conflict. The Duillog merely slipped away, disappearing into the foliage of the forest. In modern times the Duillog live in small, secret societies, still tending to their forests and protecting their sacred sites from the shadows. Despite the power they hold, they have never attempted to remove the other bugfolk from the forest, preferring peaceful coexistence.</p>

			<h3>Masters of Beast and Leaf</h3>
			<p>The Duillog all have an innate connection to the natural world, to a degree other races must use magic to emulate. Each and every Duillog have the ability to speak to beasts and plants, as well as turn invisible at will. They tend to large collections of wild bugs, using them as both guards and spies against their bugfolk neighbors. The Duillog know of every beast, plant and stone in their territory, and know exactly how each and every one can aid them.</p>

			<h3>Holy Pilgrims</h3>
			<p>The vast majority of Duillog never leave the communities they are born into, much less their forests. Rarely, however, a Duillog is sent out on a mission dictated by the tribe's leaders, often due to interpretations of the Gashalag's will. Such Duillog set out with the understanding that they are to right some wrong or restore balance to the natural order, though few start their journeys knowing what the imbalance is, or even if it has happened yet.</p>

			<h3>Duillog Names</h3>
			<p>Duillog names are multi-segmented, with two individual parts. Each half of a Duillog's name is shared with one parent or relative on that parent's side, and is chosen to represent the passing on of traits from ancestors to descendents. Duillog name segments tend to be short, with only one or two syllables</p>
			<p><strong>Blattid Names:</strong> Asa'Dul, Beelo'Ruk, Folo'Zal, Gor'Sulo, Nes'Tulo, San'Gala, Tor'Bulo, Uta'Dal<br>
