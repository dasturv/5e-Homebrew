			<em>The music gently drifted between the trees to Darutha and her group. She looked around, but the forest prevented her from pinpointed the songs direction. She began to panic, but then a feeling of lethargy overtook her. One by one her party began to lie down in the moss, their quiet snores barely noticed by her as she slumped to the forest floor. As her eyes began to close, she could barely make out a lone figure dropping from a branch above, watching her...</em>

			<h3>Enchanting Heritage</h3>
			<p>The Amhrani come not from a god, but from the pervasive magics found in the north of the Eastlands. As with all the natives of these enchanted lands, they bear unique gifts and powers. The Amhrani are masters of music and enchantment, using their powers to spread joy and wonder wherever they go. From the shores of the Addlebrook to the depths of the Whistlewood, the songs of the Amhrani soothe travellers and delight guests.</p>

			<h3>Masters of Music</h3>
			<p>Ever Amhrani is born with an innate love of music, helped by their naturally occuring instrument on their legs called a cricketfiddle. They are widely considered the best musicians in Llorelan, with nobles of other races eagerly competing to have an Amhrani as an entertainer in their court. Their music can soothe and entrance the listener, and the Amhrani are keenly aware of how they can use their powers to influence those around them.</p>

			<h3>Sacred Song</h3>
			<p>The Amhrani hold one place sacred above all others: the Singing Stones. Nestled in the arms of the Addlebrook, the Singing Stones are a series of obelisks filled with holes and channels that whistle as the wind blows through them. Every Amhrani visits the singing stones at least once in their lives as a coming of age ceremony, and it is believed that the songs of the stones are what grant them their unique powers, an idea supported by the existance of the Doraithe, Amhrani who never visited the Singing Stones and can no longer produce music and joy.</p>

			<h3>Wanderers and Nomads</h3>
			<p>There are few Amhrani who prefer to stay in any one place for long. They form clans and caravans, wandering from place to place in enchanting bliss. Many Amhrani spend at least a portion of their lives away from their kind, seeking out adventure and inspiration for new stories and songs to bring back to their people. As such, every community has hundreds of songs, poems and stories from adventures long past, whether they be herioc, comedic or serve as a dire warning.</p>

			<h3>Amhrani Names</h3>
			<p>Amhrani names tend to have an air of whimsy to them, with an emphasis of names that are simply fun to say and hear. The exception to this are the Doraithe, whose names tend to be harsh and aggressive.</p>
			<p><strong>Amhrani Names:</strong> Addilix, Doridad, Fennelin, Humphred, Ladifen, Porfas, Todilin, Zadulax<br>
			<strong>Doraithe Names:</strong> Borgugog, Gornek, Killegon, Morke, Rodogul, Ugudol, Wurgok, Yndrigel</p>
			<h3>Amhrani Traits</h3>
			<p><em><strong>Regardless of what form they take, all Amhrani share the following traits.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>

				<h6>Redeemed Doraithe</h6>
				<p>Some rare Doraithe have earned the respect and forgiveness of the rest of the Amhrani, granting them special rights to visit the Singing Stones. While some Doraithe achieve this on their own, the most famous group of the redeemed Doraithe are the followers of Iddilig Radani, a group of banished Amhrani that has settled peacefully north of the Savage Lands. Such a Doraithe loses the song-severed trait, as the magics of the Singing Stones is no longer barred from them.</p>
