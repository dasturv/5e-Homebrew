				Caelin (Butterflies)
			</div>
			<em>Grik didn't know what was happening. Just a moment ago the big bandit was shoving him into the ground at knife point, now all he heard was screams. He kept his head down, bright lights flashing all around him. After a beat, there was silence, and a hand touched his shoulder. He looked up to see the kind eyes of a bug, their wings a wave of dancing colors...</em>

			<h3>Born of Light</h3>
			<p>Every Caelin owes their existence to the realm of Celestia, a world of primordial good and light. It is said that the light of this plane comes forth into the material through the sun and moon, an idea supported by the dual types of Caelin, Lunar and Solar, who each exemplify different aspects of goodness.</p>

			<h3>Independent Souls</h3>
			<p>A Caelin can be born amongst the members of any race, to any parents. The birth of a Caelin is often considered a sacred event, with the child being assumed to have some great destiny or mission. As such, when they come to age, a Caelin often sets out into the world in pursuit of their fated destiny.</p>

			<h3>Embodiments of Virtue</h3>
			<p>Caelin tend towards the extremes of good. Zealous warriors seeking out evil, patient healers always looking to forgive and charitable freedom fighters facing off against tyrants are all commonplace amongst their numbers. A Caelin is devoted to their personal brand of good, and seek to spread it far and wide.</p>

			<h3>Pilgrims and Avengers</h3>
			<p>For a Caelin, the adventuring life comes easy. The forces of evil are powerful and widespread, and one does not combat the darkness with idleness. Whether seeking to bring comfort to the suffering or defeat some evil force, virtually every Caelin finds themself on some sort adventure.</p>

			<h3>Caelin Names</h3>
			<p>Most Caelin take a name from their parent's lineage and culture, though many also choose names that help exemplify their mission or goals.</p>
			<p><strong>Caelin Names:</strong> Faith, Freedom, Grace, Hope, Mercy, Light, Order, Wisdom<br>
