			<h3>Grugi Traits</h3>
			<p><em><strong>Regardless of what form they take, all Grugi share the following traits.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.</li>
				<li><strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are an abberation.</li>
				<li><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is medium or small. You choose when you select this lineage. Grugi vary widely, ranging from three to seven sprigs tall, and weigh between 30 and 350 pebblets.</li>
				<li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 25 sprigs.</li>
				<li><strong>Alien Mind.</strong> You have resistance to psychic damage. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws to prevent or end the frightened and charmed conditions on yourself.</li>
				<li><strong>Mindmeld.</strong> You can form a psychic link directly with a creature's mind. As a bonus action you can form a psychic link with a creature within 30 sprigs of you. While the link persists, you can communicate telepathically with that creature. You do not need to share a langauge with the creature, but it must know at least one language for you to communicate with it. The link is broken if the creature is ever more than 100 sprigs away from you or you use this feature again. A non-Grugi creature finds this psychic link disconcerting.</li>
				<li><strong>Shared Knowledge.</strong> Whenever you make a skill check while you are linked to a creature with your Mindmeld feature you gain a +2 bonus on that roll, provided the linked creature is proficient with that skill.</li>
				<li><strong>Subrace.</strong> You choose a subrace and gain its features. Choose either Hardshell or Slimesoul.</li>
				<li><strong>Languages.</strong> Your character can speak, read and write Click-clack.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Hardshell</h5>
			<p><em><strong>Hardshell Grugi sport a large, spiralling shell atop their heads. Usually larger than their shell-less kin, they are known for moving only when necessary.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Protective Meld.</strong> A creature you have linked with using your Mindmeld feature has advantage on saving throws to prevent or end the frightened and charmed conditions on itself.</li>
				<li><strong>Psychic Barrier.</strong> Whenever a creature you have linked with is dealt damage, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus.
				<ul><li>You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Slimesoul</h5>
			<p><em><strong>Slimesoul Grugi are more lithe and generally smaller than their kin. They are known for being able to use their innate psychic power more aggressively.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Disorienting Meld.</strong> A creature you have linked with using your Mindmeld feature has disadvantage on saving throws to prevent or end the frightened and charmed conditions on itself.</li>
				<li><strong>Psychic Assault.</strong> Whenever a creature you have linked with is dealt damage, you can use your reaction to deal an additional 1d10 + your proficiency bonus psychic damage to that creature.
				<ul><li>You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</li></ul></li>
