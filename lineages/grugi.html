			<h3>Grugi Traits</h3>
			<p><em><strong>Regardless of what form they take, all Grugi share the following traits.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.</li>
				<li><strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are an abberation.</li>
				<li><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is medium or small. You choose when you select this lineage. Grugi vary widely, ranging from three to seven sprigs tall, and weigh between 30 and 350 pebblets.</li>
				<li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 25 sprigs.</li>
				<li><strong>Alien Mind.</strong> You have resistance to psychic damage. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma, Intelligence or Wisdom saving throw, you can roll a d4 and add it to the total.</li>
				<li><strong>Mindmeld.</strong> You can form a psychic link directly with a creature's mind. As a bonus action you can form a psychic link with a creature within 30 sprigs of you. While the link persists, you can communicate telepathically with that creature. You do not need to share a langauge with the creature, but it must know at least one language for you to communicate with it. The link is broken if the creature is ever more than 100 sprigs away from you or you use this feature again. A non-Grugi creature finds this psychic link disconcerting.</li>
				<li><strong>Shared Knowledge.</strong> Whenever you make a skill check while you are linked to a creature with your Mindmeld feature you gain a +2 bonus on that roll, provided the linked creature is proficient with that skill.</li>
				<li><strong>Subrace.</strong> You choose a subrace and gain its features. Choose either Hardshell or Slimesoul.</li>
				<li><strong>Languages.</strong> Your character can speak, read and write Click-clack and Grugi. Grugi is predominently a telepathic language, punctuated with occasional body language.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Hardshell</h5>
			<p><em><strong>Hardshell Grugi sport a large, spiralling shell atop their heads. Usually larger than their shell-less kin, they are known for moving only when necessary.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Protective Meld.</strong> A creature you have linked with using your Mindmeld is forced to make a Charisma, Intelligence or Wisdom saving throw, you can use your reaction to roll a d4 and add it to the total. You can use this reaction before or after the roll, but before the DM announces if the roll was a success or failure.</li>
				<li><strong>Psychic Shield.</strong> As an action you can infuse your psychic link with protective power. While this feature is active, whenever you or the creature you are linked with using your Mindmeld feature takes damage, that damage is reduced by 1d4. This effect lasts for one minute but ends early if you lose concentration (as if your were concentrating on a spell) or the psychic link is broken. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.
				<ul><li>This feature's damage reduction increases when you reach certain levels. To 1d6 at 6th level and 1d8 at 14th level.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Slimesoul</h5>
			<p><em><strong>Slimesoul Grugi are more lithe and generally smaller than their kin. They are known for being able to use their innate psychic power more aggressively.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Disorientating Meld.</strong> A creature you have linked with using your Mindmeld is forced to make a Charisma, Intelligence or Wisdom saving throw, you can use your reaction to roll a d4 and subtract it from the total. You can use this reaction before or after the roll, but before the DM announces if the roll was a success or failure.</li>
				<li><strong>Psychic Drain.</strong> As an action you can infuse your psychic link with weakening power. While this feature is active, whenever the creature you are linked with using your Mindmeld feature deals damage to another creature, you can reduce that damage by 1d4. This effect lasts for one minute but ends early if you lose concentration (as if your were concentrating on a spell) or the psychic link is broken. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.
				<ul><li>This feature's damage reduction increases when you reach certain levels. To 1d6 at 6th level and 1d8 at 14th level.</li></ul></li>
