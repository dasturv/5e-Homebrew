				Grugi (Snails and Slugs)
			</div>
			<em>"Can you cut that out?" Snapped Duran, "It's so distracting." Xiltorp tilted its head curiously, but soon Duran felt the psychic tendrils recede from the back of his mind, leaving only what he could describe as a trail of slime across his psyche. He shuddered, "Please, stop doing that without letting me know first, alright?" he said, softer this time. His companion was silent for a moment before opening his wide mouth and speaking slowly and carefully, "Eaz-ear tog spea-eg ineg Dor-an min-deg. Spea-eg-ing-eg diff-eg-gult." Duran sighed deeply. If this Grugi was gonna speak this slow, maybe mind slime would be preferable.</em>

			<h3>Alien Beings</h3>
			<p>The origins of the Grugi is unknown to all, perhaps even to the Grugi themselves, though none have confirmed whether or not they know. What is known is that they are not originally from Llorelan. Their soft, slimy skin and strange psychic powers are not seen anywhere else in the world, and their presence here is both mysterious and disconcerting.</p>

			<h3>Mysterious Bonds</h3>
			<p>It is rare for more than one Grugi to be in the same area, much less interact. They are spread far and wide, seemingly with no connection. And yet, whenever two Grugi do meet, they interact as if they are close friends, and seem to uncannily be aware of all that the other has experienced. Even stranger for the bugs of Llorelan, it is not uncommon for Grugi to "speak" with one another from across great distances, learning of tidings half a world away from individuals they have never seen nor met.</p>

			<h3>Curious and Slow</h3>
			<p>The Grugi approach life with an enduring sense of wonder. It is common for a wandering Grugi to stop at seemingly random locations to watch and experience events going on there, from a small town festival to watching a hawk-fly raise its young over a series of weeks. Their curiosity pairs well with their seemingly endless patience. A Grugi will wait days, weeks or even months in order to witness an event it has its mind set on seeing.</p>

			<h3>Learning Opportunities</h3>
			<p>Many Grugi would be considered an adventurer of some sort. Wandering from place to place, meeting new folks and seeing new sights, coming together with a band of adventurers is an easy choice for a Grugi. That is, of course, a party of adventurers is willing to put up with the many quirks and oddities of a Grugi.</p>

			<h3>Lineage Names</h3>
			<p>Lineage Names Description</p>
			<p><strong>Lineage Names:</strong> 8 names<br>
			<h3>Grugi Traits</h3>
			<p><em><strong>Regardless of what form they take, all Grugi share the following traits.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.</li>
				<li><strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are an abberation.</li>
				<li><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is medium or small. You choose when you select this lineage. Grugi vary widely, ranging from three to seven sprigs tall, and weigh between 30 and 350 pebblets.</li>
				<li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 25 sprigs.</li>
				<li><strong>Alien Mind.</strong> You have resistance to psychic damage. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma, Intelligence or Wisdom saving throw, you can roll a d4 and add it to the total.</li>
				<li><strong>Mindmeld.</strong> You can form a psychic link directly with a creature's mind. As a bonus action you can form a psychic link with a creature within 30 sprigs of you. While the link persists, you can communicate telepathically with that creature. You do not need to share a langauge with the creature, but it must know at least one language for you to communicate with it. The link is broken if the creature is ever more than 100 sprigs away from you or you use this feature again. A non-Grugi creature finds this psychic link disconcerting.</li>
				<li><strong>Shared Knowledge.</strong> Whenever you make a skill check while you are linked to a creature with your Mindmeld feature you gain a +2 bonus on that roll, provided the linked creature is proficient with that skill.</li>
				<li><strong>Subrace.</strong> You choose a subrace and gain its features. Choose either Hardshell or Slimesoul.</li>
				<li><strong>Languages.</strong> Your character can speak, read and write Click-clack and Grugi. Grugi is predominently a telepathic language, punctuated with occasional body language.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Hardshell</h5>
			<p><em><strong>Hardshell Grugi sport a large, spiralling shell atop their heads. Usually larger than their shell-less kin, they are known for moving only when necessary.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Protective Meld.</strong> A creature you have linked with using your Mindmeld is forced to make a Charisma, Intelligence or Wisdom saving throw, you can use your reaction to roll a d4 and add it to the total. You can use this reaction before or after the roll, but before the DM announces if the roll was a success or failure.</li>
				<li><strong>Psychic Shield.</strong> As an action you can infuse your psychic link with protective power. While this feature is active, whenever you or the creature you are linked with using your Mindmeld feature takes damage, that damage is reduced by 1d4. This effect lasts for one minute but ends early if you lose concentration (as if your were concentrating on a spell) or the psychic link is broken. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.
				<ul><li>This feature's damage reduction increases when you reach certain levels. To 1d6 at 6th level and 1d8 at 14th level.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Slimesoul</h5>
			<p><em><strong>Slimesoul Grugi are more lithe and generally smaller than their kin. They are known for being able to use their innate psychic power more aggressively.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Disorientating Meld.</strong> A creature you have linked with using your Mindmeld is forced to make a Charisma, Intelligence or Wisdom saving throw, you can use your reaction to roll a d4 and subtract it from the total. You can use this reaction before or after the roll, but before the DM announces if the roll was a success or failure.</li>
				<li><strong>Psychic Drain.</strong> As an action you can infuse your psychic link with weakening power. While this feature is active, whenever the creature you are linked with using your Mindmeld feature deals damage to another creature, you can reduce that damage by 1d4. This effect lasts for one minute but ends early if you lose concentration (as if your were concentrating on a spell) or the psychic link is broken. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.
				<ul><li>This feature's damage reduction increases when you reach certain levels. To 1d6 at 6th level and 1d8 at 14th level.</li></ul></li>
