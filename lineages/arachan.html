				Arachan (Spiders)
			</div>
			<em>The great spider pounced forwards towards the pair, the mother clutching her child in mindless fear. Suddenly there was a flash of light as an Arachan appeared above it, using gravity and his weight to stab a spear into the beasts thrashing head. It roared and gargled before sliding to a stop, dead. The pair silently looked up to their savior. He tried to smile. The mother screamed and ran, dragging her child behind her. The Arachan sighed. "At least they are safe," he thought to himself...</em>
			<br><br>

			<h3>Born of Darkness</h3>
			<p>Every Arachan is touched by the foul magic of the Demonweb Pits, a realm of darkness and nightmares. The horrifying demonic Spiders of this realm crawl from the darkest corners of the world to prey upon all of bug-kind. Every Arachan shares a bloodline with these Spiders, and a deep malicious hunger rests deep within each, whether they fight it or embrace it.</p>

			<h3>Hushed Outcasts</h3>
			<p>To have an Arachan born within a community is considered a mark of some great sin. As such, most are hidden away or cast out from their families and communities. These Arachan are forced to grow up fast and learn how to survive in a world that neither loves nor trusts them.</p>

			<h3>Bitter Hardship</h3>
			<p>Most Arachan die young, alone and afraid. Cast out from their communities and shunned by the world, the few who learn to survive do so on their own or are taught by a more experienced Arachan or other mentor. facing such hardships, the few who make it in the world show a resolve truly rare amongst other bugs, with impossible odds merely being a fact of life for the Arachan.</p>

			<h3>Misfits and Vagabonds</h3>
			<p>Arachan come quite easily to the adventuring life. Whether through selfish greed or simply trying to help the world in spite of the intolerance they face, many Arachan's only family is that of an group of adventurers.</p>

			<h3>Arachan Names</h3>
			<p>While most Arachan do have a birth name, most never use it as it reminds them of a painful past. Instead, most Arachan choose their own name, whether to intimidate or put others at ease.</p>
			<p><strong>Lineage Names:</strong> Bolyuth, Candy, Hunter, Magleth, Peace, Venom, Virtue, Weaver <br>
