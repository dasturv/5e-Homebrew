				Vespid (Bees)
			</div>
			<em>It didn't seem possible. The city expanded from a single branch, seemingly weightless in the iar, its golden spires of amber reaching far into the sky. Pwyll looked in astonishment as countless bugs buzzed past her, the setting sun casting a warm light across the city. "Welcome to Alasantra," Osano smirked, "A bit bigger than your home town, I assume?"</em>
			<br><br>

			<h3>Arboreal Empires</h3>
			<p>The Vespids live in vast hive-cities in the canopies of mighty trees. Each of these cities can house millions of individual Vespids, each living their lives for the benefit of the hive. These cities are virtually unassailable, and from their strongholds the Vespids have spread across almost all of the westlands, from Pitchwood in the north to the borders of the Dreadmoor.</p>

			<h3>Energetic Artisans</h3>
			<p>The Vespids are a skilled and active race. Their artisans are second to none, besides perhaps their sister race the Formids, and their mastery over the materials of amber, honey and wax has solidified them as the dominant force in the westlands. every Vespid has at least one artisan trade they follow, and they take to it with a passion and pride not found in many bugs.</p>

			<h3>In Service of the Queen</h3>
			<p>The Vespids were originally created by Evenala, also known as the Amber Queen and the twin to the Formid goddess Alowe. The Vespids see Evenala as their queen above queens, their mother and benevolent protector. They work diligently to expand her empire and fiercely defend her mortal form, sealed in the capital tree of Amberhome.</p>

			<h3>Extensions of Home</h3>
			<p>While it is far from rare for a Vespid to temporarily leave their hive to explore or trade, many loathe to be away from home for long. Though sometimes, a rare Vespid is filled with a desire to explore the outside world. when this happens, the Vespids believe that individual experiencing the pull is being called by Evenala to some greater task outside of the safety of the cities, and may even begin their own hive.</p>

			<h3>Vespid Names</h3>
			<p>Vespid names tend to both start and end with a vowel and have a flowing, airy energy to them. Many Vespids also punctuate their name with a unique blend of pheremones and body language such as wiggling antennae, buzzing wings, etc..</p>
			<p><strong>Vespid Names:</strong> Asalahad, Alavona, Estrili, Ellavali, Ilinitri, Isoliri, Osana, Olarti, Usanti, Uvarosa, Ysildri </p>
			<h3>Vespid Traits</h3>
			<p><em><strong>Regardless of what form they take, all Vespids share the following traits.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.</li>
				<li><strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are an insectoid.</li>
				<li><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is medium. Vespids tend to be between four and seven sprigs tall, and weigh anywhere between 100 and 300 pebblets.</li>
				<li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 30 sprigs.</li>
				<li><strong>Artisan.</strong> You gain proficiency with one artisan tool of your choice.</li>
				<li><strong>Cooperative.</strong> You can take the help action as a bonus action.</li>
				<li><strong>Stinger.</strong> You have a stinger that you can use for unarmed strikes. When you hit with your stinger, the strike deals 1 + your Strength modifier piercing damage instead of the normal damage from an unarmed strike and the target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.) On a failed save the target takes 1d4 poison damage. This damage increases by 1d4 when you reach certain levels: 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4) and 17th level (4d4).</li>
				<li><strong>Subrace.</strong> You choose a subrace and gain its features. Choose one: Amberwise, Strongmane or Swiftsting.</li>
				<li><strong>Languages.</strong> Your character can speak, read and write Click-clack and Vespid. Vespid is an intense language of sounds, pheremones and body language overlapping to create levels of nuance that is hard for other bugs to understand.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Amberwise</h5>
			<p><em><strong>Residents of the Greenwood, the Amberwise are the most populous and powerful of the Vespids, their beautiful artwork and mastery of amber is famous across the world.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Amberwise Magic.</strong> You know one cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list. Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (you choose when you select this lineage.)</li></li>
				<li><strong>Benevolent.</strong> Whenever you take the help action, you can choose to bolster the helped creature's resolve. If you do, the helped creature gains temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Strongmanes</h5>
			<p><em><strong>Natives of Pitchwood, the Strongmanes are larger and stronger than the rest of their kin. they are masters of wax, using it to create impossibly strong structures.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Durable.</strong> Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.</li>
				<li><strong>Powerful Build.</strong> You count as one size larger for the purposes of of determing your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag or lift.</li></li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Swiftsting</h5>
			<p><em><strong>Once the Swiftstings called a great forest home, but the plagues of Maghorne killed their trees and left them bitterly without homes or amber.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Nomadic.</strong> Your walking speed increases to 35 feet.</li></li>
				<li><strong>Potent Venom.</strong> The poison damage from your stinger trait is increased to 1d6. This damage increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels: 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6) and 17th level (4d6)</li></li>
