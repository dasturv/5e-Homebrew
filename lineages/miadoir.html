			<h3>Miadoir Traits</h3>
			<p><em><strong>Regardless of what form they take, all Miadoirans share the following traits.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>

				<li><strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are an insectoid.</li>
				<li><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is medium or small. You choose when you select this lineage. Miadoirans range from three to seven sprigs, and weight between 50 and 350 pebblets.</li>
				<li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 30 sprigs.</li>
				<li><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 60 sprigs of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.</li>
				<li><strong>Fey Ancestry.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself.</li>
				<li><strong>Sonic Resistance.</strong> You have resistance to thunder damage.</li>
				<li><strong>Subrace.</strong> You choose a subrace and gain its features. Choose one: Marauder, Scorned or Scout.</li>

			</ul>
			<h5>Marauder</h5>
			<p><em><strong>The remnants of the former soldier caste, the Marauder Miadoirans form loose bands of warriors, raiding other bugs in terrifying surprise attacks under the cover of darkness, using shock tactics and intimidation to end the battle quickly.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Bite.</strong> You have a set of bladed mandibles that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</li>
				<li><strong>Rampage.</strong> When you score a critical hit or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on your turn, you can take a bonus action to move up to half your speed and make a bite attack.</li>
				<li><strong>Savage Attacks.</strong> When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Scorned</h5>
			<p><em><strong>Once the royalty and nobles of the Miadoir, the Scorned now use their innate magic to hamper enemy mages, gathering bands of other Miadoir to attack their hated Scraedai rivals.</strong></em></p>

You choose which ability when you choose this lineage.</li></ul></li>
				<li><strong>Wings.</strong> Starting at 5th level, you can use a bonus action to magically strengthen your wings for 1 minute. For the duration, you gain a fly speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until yout complete a long rest.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Scout</h5>
			<p><em><strong>Formerly serving as the foragers, artisans and hunters of the Miadoir, now the Scouts live as stealthy raiders, spying on their foes and picking off exposed enemies.</strong></em></p>
