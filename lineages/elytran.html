				Elytran
			</div>
			<em>Tael was taken aback by Groll's family. So many bugs of such different size, color and temperment. The diversity crammed in this one small home could easily rival the entirety of Brookspire. Tael watched in awe as Groll strolled forward, chittering a warm welcome as his family surrounded him in excitement.</em>
			<br><br>

			<h3>Diverse and Adaptable</h3>
			<p>There is no such thing as a typical Elytran. With their widespread populations and large families, no two Elytrans look exactly alike, not even closely related ones. Elytrans range from only 3 sprigs tall to almost 9 and weighing from as little as 30 pebblets to over 300. Their carapaces can be virtually any color, with nearly endless patterns, textures and shapes. Elytrans are also just as diverse in mentality as the are physically, with Elytrans finding their ways into many cultures and lifestyles.</p>

			<h3>Large Families, Broad Bonds</h3>
			<p>An Elytran family is a sight to behold. Often over two dozen individuals, their homes tend to be a constant buzz of activity. In addition, families tend to keep in close contact with relatives, even distant ones. It is not uncommon for an Elytran to have at least one family member in every major city (and many minor ones). Elytrans are also well known for adopting other races, and even considering close friends as family.</p>

			<h3>Love of Differences</h3>
			<p>Elytrans are almost universally proud of what makes them unique from others. An Elytran with an exceptionally beautiful shell will likely highlight it with jewelry and clothing that accent it’s colors, whereas an Elytran who prides itself on physical strength will go out of its way to prove its strength to others. This love of the unique extends towards others, with many Elytrans prefering companions that are different from themselves. In fact, it is often considered an insult to mimic an Elytran, as it is seen as someone claiming they can do what the Elytran can, but better.</p>

			<h3>Far and Wide</h3>
			<p>Elytrans can be found in every corner of Llorelan, and virtually every nation, city and kingdom have their fair share of them. Making their homes wherever they reasonably can, Elytrans cheerfully and tenaciously work their way into many cultures, and while they rarely seek to lead their communities, most settlements have a population of Elytrans far to large to ignore.</p>

			<h3>Elytran Names</h3>
			<p>An Elytran family’s method of giving names is as diverse as they are as a race. Many Elytrans have names from whatever culture they were raised from, and many others give themselves a new name throughout their life. When they are left to their own devices, however, Elytran names tend to be short and simple, which is thought to allow the new Elytran to choose their future for themselves without a name to push them down a set path. Family names are rarely used, as with how diverse they can be they tell very little. Instead most Elytrans use a nickname that describes them.</p>
			<p><strong>Masculine Names:</strong> Bok, Dral, Groll, Jed, Kol, Mard, Thuck, Quil, Ral, Tir, Wult, Yrm<br>
			<strong>Feminine Names:</strong> Bri, Dot, Fyrn, Jas, Kaz, Lis, Nor, Pwyll, Tez, Vex, Yem<br>
			<strong>Nicknames:</strong> Fireheart, Fleetwing, Pearlshell, Rubyeye, Smoothword, Stillsoul, Strongjaw, Quickwit</p>

			<h3>Elytran Traits</h3>

			<ul>
