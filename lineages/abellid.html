				Abellid (Bees)
			</div>
			<em>It didn't seem possible. The city expanded from a single branch, seemingly weightless in the iar, its golden spires of amber reaching far into the sky. Pwyll looked in astonishment as countless bugs buzzed past her, the setting sun casting a warm light across the city. "Welcome to Alasantra," Osano smirked, "A bit bigger than your home town, I assume?"</em>
			<br><br>

			<h3>Tireless and Graceful</h3>
			<p>Amongst the bugs of Llorelan, few capture a greater sense of awe than the Abellids. Often slightly taller than an average bug, an Abellid moves with and air of purpose and tirelessness that makes everything they do seem easy. Their carapaces are usually covered in striking yellows and oranges paired with bold black stripes, though reds, browns, blues and even greens are not unheard of. In order to accent their natural beauty, most Abellids wear simple, draping garbs and amber jewelry, allowing a lot of their natural colors to show.</p>

			<h3>Energetic Artisans</h3>
			<p>The Abellids are a skilled and active people. Every Abellid has at least one trade they work tirelessly and passionately upon, creating some of the greatest works of artisanship Llorelan has to offer. An Abellid takes great pride in their work, and their mastery of construction, alchemy and especially amber has cemented them as the dominant force on Losterre.</p>

			<h3>In Service of Others</h3>
			<p>The Abellids innately crave cooperation and community, working endlessly to expand and protect their sisters, hives and empires. Though, unlike their more insular sisters the Formids, the Abellids eagerly incorporate bugs of other species into their communities, treating them as beloved sisters.</p>

			<h3>Arboreal Empires</h3>
			<p>The Abellids live in vast hive-cities in the canopies of mighty trees. Each of these massive cities can house millions of Abellids, each living their lives in service of their hive. These great cities are virtually unassailable, and from their strongholds they project power across Losterre, from the Sevenoire in the far north to the Effroimar in the south.</p>

			<h3>Extensions of Home</h3>
			<p>While it is far from rare for a Abellid to temporarily leave their hive to explore or trade, many loathe to be away from home for long. Though sometimes, a rare Abellid is filled with a desire to explore the outside world. when this happens, the Abellids believe that individual experiencing the pull is being called by Evenala to some greater task outside of the safety of the cities, and may even begin their own hive.</p>

			<h3>Abellid Names</h3>
			<p>Abellid names tend to both start and end with a vowel and have a flowing, airy energy to them. With the rarity of males, there is no distinction between masculine and feminine names, though specific hives oftentimes have their own naming conventions. In addition to their spoken name, many Abellids also use a unique blend of expressions and body language such as wiggling antennae, buzzing wings, etc. to their name.</p>
			<p><strong>Abellid Names:</strong> Asalahad, Alavona, Estrili, Ellavali, Ilinitri, Isoliri, Osana, Olarti, Usanti, Uvarosa, Ysildri </p>
