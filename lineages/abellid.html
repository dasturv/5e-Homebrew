				Abellid (Bees)
			</div>
			<em>It didn't seem possible. The city expanded from a single branch, seemingly weightless in the iar, its golden spires of amber reaching far into the sky. Pwyll looked in astonishment as countless bugs buzzed past her, the setting sun casting a warm light across the city. "Welcome to Alasantra," Osano smirked, "A bit bigger than your home town, I assume?"</em>
			<br><br>

			<h3>Arboreal Empires</h3>
			<p>The Abellids live in vast hive-cities in the canopies of mighty trees. Each of these cities can house millions of individual Abellids, each living their lives for the benefit of the hive. These cities are virtually unassailable, and from their strongholds the Abellids have spread across almost all of the westlands, from Pitchwood in the north to the borders of the Dreadmoor.</p>

			<h3>Energetic Artisans</h3>
			<p>The Abellids are a skilled and active race. Their artisans are second to none, besides perhaps their sister race the Formids, and their mastery over the materials of amber, honey and wax has solidified them as the dominant force in the westlands. every Abellid has at least one artisan trade they follow, and they take to it with a passion and pride not found in many bugs.</p>

			<h3>In Service of the Queen</h3>
			<p>The Abellids were originally created by Evenala, also known as the Amber Queen and the twin to the Formid goddess Alowe. The Abellids see Evenala as their queen above queens, their mother and benevolent protector. They work diligently to expand her empire and fiercely defend her mortal form, sealed in the capital tree of Amberhome.</p>

			<h3>Extensions of Home</h3>
			<p>While it is far from rare for a Abellid to temporarily leave their hive to explore or trade, many loathe to be away from home for long. Though sometimes, a rare Abellid is filled with a desire to explore the outside world. when this happens, the Abellids believe that individual experiencing the pull is being called by Evenala to some greater task outside of the safety of the cities, and may even begin their own hive.</p>

			<h3>Abellid Names</h3>
			<p>Abellid names tend to both start and end with a vowel and have a flowing, airy energy to them. Many Abellids also punctuate their name with a unique blend of pheremones and body language such as wiggling antennae, buzzing wings, etc..</p>
			<p><strong>Abellid Names:</strong> Asalahad, Alavona, Estrili, Ellavali, Ilinitri, Isoliri, Osana, Olarti, Usanti, Uvarosa, Ysildri </p>
			<h3>Abellid Traits</h3>
			<p><em><strong>Regardless of what form they take, all Abellids share the following traits.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.</li>
				<li><strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are an insectoid.</li>
				<li><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is medium. Abellids tend to be between four and seven sprigs tall, and weigh anywhere between 100 and 300 pebblets.</li>
				<li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 30 sprigs.</li>
				<li><strong>Artisan.</strong> You gain proficiency with one artisan tool of your choice.</li>
				<li><strong>Busy.</strong> You are a buzz of activity, requiring less rest than other bugs. You only need to sleep 4 hours to complete a long rest.</li>
