			<em>The group looked around in awe at the city around them. Grand pillars rose to the ceiling far above, houses and buildings built into their sides, spiralling up into the darkness. Arches covered in carvings of mighty battles and heroes stretched above them. "Yunno, if we weren't prisoners right now, this may be pretty cool," grumbled Sethel. A nearby guard clicked his jaws in annoyance as the cage the group was trapped in rolled further towards the keep.</em>

			<h3>Empire of Royalty</h3>
			<p>The fierce Formids live in a strict society, where one's form decides what role they play. From small workers, to massive guards and elegant scions, each Formid has a job to ensure the colony's survival. While other bugs may balk at what they would call tyranny, many Formids take on their duty with pride and vigor. Fiercely loyal to their colony and their queen (whom all Formids are born to), most would gladly give their life for the safety of their home.</p>

			<h3>Sisters in Strength</h3>
			<p>All Formids are female besides the rare male scion (called a drone). As such, concepts of gender are vague at best. In addition, since only queens and scions can reproduce, the only family most Formids have is their colony. Formids protect each other as family, a sentiment the rare Formid outside of a colony is often happy to extend to its close friends.</p>

			<h3>Queen Under the Mountain</h3>
			<p>The Formids were originally created by their goddess Alowe, the Queen Under the Mountain and twin of the Abellid goddess Evenala. The Formids see themselves as the children and grandchildren of Alowe, and their priestesses and queens go through great lengths to emulate their creator's ability to bring stability and prosperity to their colonies. The mortal form of Alowe is said to be encased deep beneath the earth, impenetrable and safe.</p>

			<h3>Dedication and Pride</h3>
			<p>All Formids take deep pride in their work, regardless of what that work is. Workers put great care into their projects, guards pride themselves in their ability to protect others, and scions and queens take great satifaction in growing their colony. Formid architecture and goods are some of the highest quality in all of Llorelan, only rivalled by the Formid's sister race, the Abellids.</p>

			<h3>Unwilling Adventurers</h3>
			<p>Very few Formids are willing to leave their colonies. As such the few Formids that do are often envoys from their colony or a survivor from a fallen colony. either way, Formids try and mimic the structure of a colony whenever possible, finding individuals to surround themselves with. The exception are scions and drones, who leave the colony in order to form new ones of their own.</p>

			<h3>Formid Names</h3>
			<p>While within their colonies, Formids rarely find the need to have names in the traditional sense. Between themselves the use of unique pheromones is all the identification required. However, while dealing with other cultures, verbal names are required. Formids who spend a lot of time dealing with other races will often take elegant sounding names with lengthy titles. Those who are away from a colony due to happenstance, however, will often pick up a name to do with their appearance or profession.</p>
			<p><strong>Formid Names:</strong> Aladula, Darutha, Esendyl, Hollista, Illivar, Lyssanti, Oryen, Seleste, Volundi<br>
			<strong>Formid Nicknames:</strong> Big, Cutter, Forager, Hunter, Rocky, Snipper, Tiny </p>
