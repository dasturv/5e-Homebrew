				Variant Rule: Critical Effects
			</div>
			<p><em>In standard 5e DnD, mundane weapons are frankly quite boring, and the classes that use them have to work much harder to do interesting things with them. With these rules, martial characters can have more impact for their party and grant even early game martials a new support option.</em></p>
			<p><em>Inspiration: Baldurs Gate 3.</em></p>
			<h3>Damage Effects</h3>
			<p>When using this variant rule, scoring a critical hit against a creature with a weapon applies a special effect based on the weapon's damage type. See below for the effect for each damage type.</p>
			<p><strong>Bludgeoning.</strong> The creature cannot take opportunity attacks and has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws until the end of your next turn.</p>
			<p><strong>Piercing.</strong> The attack deals additional damage equal to your proficiency modifer. Additionally, the creature has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws until the end of your next turn.</p>
			<p><strong>Slashing.</strong> The creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet and it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws until the end of your next turn.</p>
			<h3>Called Shots</h3>
			<p>Using this variant rule, critical hits are not the only way to apply damage effects. A player can also declare a weapon attack to be a called shot. When they do so, that attack roll is made at disadvantage, and if it hits, the attack gains the damage effect as if it was a critical hit.</p>
