			<h3>Kamakri Traits</h3>
			<p><em><strong>Regardless of what form they take, all Kamakri share the following traits.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.</li>
				<li><strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are an insectoid.</li>
				<li><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is medium. Kamakri tend to be between 5 and 7 sprigs tall, and weigh up to 250 pebblets.</li>
				<li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 30 sprigs.</li>
				<li><strong>Claws.</strong> You sport a pair of long, sharp blades on the end of each arm. When you hit with your claws, the attack deals 1d6 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier piercing damage instead of the normal damage from an unarmed strike.</li>
				<li><strong>Ambusher.</strong> You have advantage on initiative rolls.</li>
				<li><strong>Subrace.</strong> You choose a subrace and gain its features. Choose either Blossom or Emerald.</li>
				<li><strong>Languages.</strong> Your character can speak, read and write Click-clack and Kamakrin. Kamakrin is an aggressive language filled with quick, harsh sounds.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Ran-Kamakri (Blossom)</h5>
			<p><em><strong>Blossom Kamakri are descended from the warrior-monk followers of the demigod Tamotsu, who found tranquility in the valley of blossoms and with the Great Tree of Peace, Kishima, a powerful goddess. From their serene home the Ran-Kamakri seek enlightenment through meditation and training.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Calm Mind.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself.</li>
				<li><strong>Enlightened Defense.</strong> Whenever you fail a saving throw, you can roll a d8 and add it to the total, potentially turning the failure into a success. Once you use this feature to succeed on a saving throw, you cannot use it again until you comlpete a long rest.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Ken-Kamakri (Sword)</h5>
			<p><em><strong>Ken-Kamakri wander the Eastlands from coast to coast as warlords, wandering warriors and loyal bodyguards. Driven by a fierce martial pride and sense of honor, they seek battle to further hone their skills in warfare.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Brave.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the frightened condition on yourself.</li>
				<li><strong>Unerring Accuracy.</strong> Whenever you miss an attack, you can roll a d8 and add it to the attack roll, potentially turning the miss into a hit. Once you use this feature to hit an attack, you cannot use it again until you comlpete a long rest.</li>
