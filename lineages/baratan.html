				Baratan (Roaches)
			</div>
			<em>Osana had to duck under a root as she descended into the Baratan camp. She was shocked by how large it was, with dozens of individuals scurrying about, cooking food, breaking down the carcass of some hunted creature, all of them living their lives. And yet, from above she had neither seen nor saw or even smelled any trace of them. If her compatriots hadn't guided her to the entrance, she would have never known...</em>
			<br><br>

			<h3>Resilient Survivors</h3>
			<p>Long ago, the land the Baratan call home was a lush rainforest, a place where they lived and died in peace. However, that world is no more, as the ascension of the god Maghorne and his pestilence had long ago destroyed the jungle, transforming it into the Dreadmoor, a fetid swamp rife with disease and monsters. The Baratan who survive do so under constant threat, but while others may struggle to find food and shelter in such a harsh and hostile environment, the Baratan have succeeded.</p>

			<h3>Hunter Gatherers</h3>
			<p>The Baratan live closely with their environment, living off the land and moving often. This lifestyle keeps them safe from ever getting found and enslaved by the Muscans they share the swamps with, but has also severely limited their access to technology and innovation. The majority of Baratan live in small family groups of no more than 50 individuals, setting up hidden camps while they extract resources from an area and moving on quickly.</p>

			<h3>Purely Pragmatic</h3>
			<p>Their harsh surroundings have pushed many Baratan to a cold, nearly callous, level of pragmatism. A Baratan that is injured or ill to the point where it can no longer keep up with the group is generally killed or left behind, and Baratan are not above consuming their fallen friends and family during lean times. However, despite this, they have a logical reason for their actions. An individual slowing down a group puts all of them at risk of discovery and capture, and killing the individual is the best way to ensure they neither become a slave nor a monster.</p>

			<h3>A Secret War</h3>
			<p>Despite their lack of organization, the Baratan have never forgotten what their home once was, and they know exactly who took it away from them. The Baratan readily raid and kill Muscans where they outnumber them. The Baratan's impact on the Muscan supply lines and settlements have had no small part with the Muscan's continued containment within the Dreadmoor.</p>

			<h3>Baratan Names</h3>
			<p>A Baratan's name tends be one passed down across generations, with the hope that the newborn will inherit some of their ancestor's desirable traits. Each Baratan clan has a name that comes from their founding member, and new clans only appear when a Baratan commits a deed great enough to warrant a new name. Baratan names tend to have many hissing sounds incorporated into them.</p>
			<p><strong>Baratan Names:</strong> Bossul, Essolus, Felesso, Hesseb, Lossoro, Sassoleb, Valess, Yesev <br>
			<strong>Clan Names:</strong> Biteback, Fatalsting, Maggotsplitter, Rootmuncher, Starseer, Stonecoil, Strongshell, Warbringer<br>
			<h3>Baratan Traits</h3>
			<p><em><strong>Regardless of what form they take, all Baratan share the following traits.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.</li>
				<li><strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are an insectoid.</li>
				<li><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is medium. Baratan tend to be between three and six sprigs tall, and weigh up to 300 pebblets.</li>
				<li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 30 sprigs.</li>
				<li><strong>Hardy.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against poisons and disease.</li>
				<li><strong>Nature's Intuition.</strong> You gain proficiency with one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Stealth or Survival.</li>
				<li><strong>Subrace.</strong> You choose a subrace and gain its features. Choose either Hissing or Roving.</li>
				<li><strong>Languages.</strong> Your character can speak, read and write Click-clack and Baratan. Baratan is a flowing language made up of hisses punctuated by rapid clicks.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Hissing</h5>
			<p><em><strong>Hissing Baratan have a thick, defensive shell and a stronger connection to the mystical aspects of nature than their kin. They server as healers and shamans for their clan, using their mystical powers in the support of their clan's survival.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Natural Armor.</strong> Your shell provides you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You cannot wear light, medium or heavy armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.</li>
				<li><strong>Natural Connection.</strong> You know one cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list. Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (you choose when you select this lineage.)</li></li>
				<li><strong>Shell Defense.</strong> You can curl up into a ball as an action. Until you uncurl, you gain a +4 bonus to your AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are prone, you speed is 0 and can't increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can't take reactions and the only action you can take is a bonus action to uncurl.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Roving</h5>
			<p><em><strong>Roving Baratan are fierce survivalists and hunters, serving as the hunters and warriors of their clans. They boast an incredible resilience, surviving blows that would kill any other.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Deeper Intuition.</strong> You gain proficiency with one additional skill from the options provided by your Nature's Intuition trait.</li></li>
				<li><strong>Natural Armor.</strong> Your thick carapace protects you. While you are not wearing armor, your base AC of 13 + your Dexterity Modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.</li>
				<li><strong>Relentless.</strong> When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this trait, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a long rest.</li></li>
