				Drakan (Dragonflies)

			<em>Time had not dulled Vezera's carapace at all. Daz knelt before the clan-matron, silently bowing his head in reverence. Her stern silence gripped him for a moment, before she spoke: "Rise, Dazzazn of clan Phrahdandron, you have done well, and honored your clan." He rose shakily, her words not fully taking root. Her eyes softened slightly, before a faint smile twitched across her mandibles. "Welcome home, child," she whispered...</em>

			<h3>Born of Dragonflies</h3>
			<p>The Drakan trace their origin not to a god, but to the mighty dragonflies, and the first members of the ancient dragonfly cults. When the first bugfolk discovered the Dragonspire, many took up residence there despite the risks, awestruck with the majesty of the dragonflies. The dragonflies there tolerated their presence, and over time began to accept offerings and even interact with these bugfolk. One by one, the bugfolk began to swear their loyalty to individual dragons, serving them as kings and gods. Over generations, these families were so infused with draconic power that their very bodies were changed, becoming the first Drakan.</p>

			<h3>Proud Clans, Bitter Rivals</h3>
			<p>To the Drakan, there are few things more important than the clan. To be part of a clan is a mark of pride, and to be cast out from one is considered a dishonor worse than death. Each member of a clan takes great effort to maintain their clan's honor, and a slight against a single member is a slight against the entire clan. Every clan has a long list of aid provided and insults given by the other Drakan clans, and members are expected to never pass up an opportunity to repay a good deed nor punish a slight.</p>

			<h3>Absolute, Resolute</h3>
			<p>The Drakan are a people of extremes, and are proud to be so. To the Drakan, to falter in one's beliefs shows weakness and dishonors the clan, and as such many Drakan cling to the ideals of their clan with a resolution that is both admirable and infuriating. One clan may be full of Drakan dedicated to the ideals of kindness and honor, whereas another may be made of tyrants, emulating the ideals of power and control.</p>

			<h3>Drakan Names</h3>
			<p>A Drakan's name is taken from the Draconic tongue, and is often long and difficult for those of other races to say. As such, most Drakan who interact with other bugfolk regularly use a shortened, simplified version for ease of use. Drakan clans take the name of the dragonfly that founded it.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Breath Weapon.</strong> When you take the attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of destructive energy. It deals damage in an area according to your ancestry. Each creature in that area must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your ancestry. The DC is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 damage of the type associated with your ancestry. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.
					<ul><li>The damage dealt by this feature increases by 1d10 when you reach certain levels: 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10) and 17th level (4d10).</li></ul></li>
				<li><strong>Draconic Resistance.</strong> You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.</li>
				<li><strong>Draconic Wings.</strong> Starting at 5th level, you can use a bonus action to magically strengthen your wings for 1 minute. For the duration, you gain a fly speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until yout complete a long rest.</li>
				<li><strong>Imposing.</strong> You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill.</li>
				<li><strong>Languages.</strong> Your character can speak, read and write Click-clack and Draconic. Draconic is a harsh language full of hard consonants and sibilants.</li>
