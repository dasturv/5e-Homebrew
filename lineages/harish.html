				Harish (Centipedes)
			</div>
			<em>Dob squinted against the desert sun. He was not used to the heat, and every step felt agonizing. He looked in wonder at his escorts, a pair of well armed and armored Harish, moving steadily despite their heavy armor. His wonderings was interupted as he was pulled down from his steed, the muscular coils of one of his guards wrapping tightly around him as massive dark shapes emerged from the sands around them. He saw the other Harish drawing his weapon, a serrated arrow embedded in his chest, and arrow meant for Dob...</em>

			<h3>Scions of the Wyrm</h3>
			<p>In ages past the greatest of the gods was the Great Wyrm, nameless and voracious. This deity carved tunnels and consumed prey across Llorelan, before he came upon the scorpion god C'tar. The two fought for ten days and ten nights before the Great Wyrm cast his foe down, though not before being stung by the venomous god. Over eons the Great Wyrm waned in power, eventually dying within the Wyrmtooth mountains. It is said that the first Harish were born from the blood the Great Worm spilled battling his foe, a mark of pride for the Harish, and a reminder to exactly who took their god away.</p>

			<h3>Martial Kingdoms</h3>
			<p>The Harish have formed several kingdoms and empires within the savage lands through martial prowess and shrewd diplomacy. They are masters of war and trade, using their mighty militaries to keep trade routes safe from raiders. From their fortresses within the Wyrmtooth mountains they project order and strength far across the deserts of the savage lands.</p>

			<h3>Proud and Unforgiving</h3>
			<p>Much like the desert they call home, the Harish are a harsh people. They impose strict codes of conduct on themselves and those within their kingdoms, with the laws themselves carved into a large stone structure in the center of each city, called the Talab. Those who infringe upon these laws are punished severely. That being said, as long as an outsider follows their laws, they are treated with a surprising respect and cordiality. There is only one exception to this: the Harish despise the Eqrab, whom they hold responsible for their god's demise.</p>

			<h3>Mercenaries and Merchants</h3>
			<p>Despite their rigid culture, there is little in the way of familial ties for the Harish. It is far from uncommon for a Harish to leave their homes in search of opportunity, using their formidable strength and shrewd mind to accrue wealth and resources wherever they go. Many become renowned for their dedication, and bring many treasures back to their homelands.</p>

			<h3>Harish Names</h3>
			<p>Harish names are taken from the Kaf'Alasma, or Cave of Names. This sacred place is said to be housed within the stone heart of the Great Worm's corpse, and its walls are covered in names of ancient Harish, those who still lived alongside the Great Wyrm. The Harish beleive that having a name not from the Kaf'Alasma severs one from their divine heritage, and no new names will be added until the Great Wyrm returns. Similarly, Harish surnames come from the first Harish to be born from their god's blood.</p>
			<p><strong>Harish Names:</strong> Aida, Amir, Farah, Hakim, Najwa, Khalid, Sahar, Yazid<br>
			<strong>Harish Surnames:</strong> Al'Bashir, Bas'Elham, In'Nazim, Haz'Akeem, Jah'Saladin, Kha'Talib, Nuh'Oma, Rash'Tana</p>
			<h3>Harish Traits</h3>
			<p><em><strong>Regardless of what form they take, all Harish share the following traits.</strong></em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> When determining your character's ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.</li>
				<li><strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are an insectoid.</li>
				<li><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is medium. Harish tend to be between 5 and 7 sprigs tall, but can be nearly twice as long. You weigh up to 400 pebblets.</li>
				<li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 35 sprigs.</li>
				<li><strong>Constriction.</strong> Your constricting body is a natural weapon which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with your constrict attack, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, and the target is grappled (escape DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and you canâ€™t constrict another target.</li>
				<li><strong>Saving Face.</strong> Whenever you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check or saving throw, you can gain a bonus to that roll equal to the number of allies within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +5), potentially turning the failure to a success. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long or short rest.</li>
				<li><strong>Martial Prowess.</strong> You have proficiency with one martial weapon of your choice.</li>
				<li><strong>Languages.</strong> Your character can speak, read and write Click-clack and Harish. Harish is a rigid language full of guttural growls and clicks.</li>
