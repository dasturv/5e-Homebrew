			<!-- <em>Dob squinted against the desert sun. He was not used to the heat, and every step felt agonizing. He looked in wonder at his escorts, a pair of well armed and armored Harish, moving steadily despite their heavy armor. His wonderings was interupted as he was pulled down from his steed, the muscular coils of one of his guards wrapping tightly around him as massive dark shapes emerged from the sands around them. He saw the other Harish drawing his weapon, a serrated arrow embedded in his chest, and arrow meant for Dob...</em>

			<h3>Scions of the Wyrm</h3>
			<p>In ages past the greatest of the gods was the Great Wyrm, nameless and voracious. This deity carved tunnels and consumed prey across Llorelan, before he came upon the scorpion god C'tar. The two fought for ten days and ten nights before the Great Wyrm cast his foe down, though not before being stung by the venomous god. Over eons the Great Wyrm waned in power, eventually dying within the Wyrmtooth mountains. It is said that the first Harish were born from the blood the Great Worm spilled battling his foe, a mark of pride for the Harish, and a reminder to exactly who took their god away.</p>

			<h3>Martial Kingdoms</h3>
			<p>The Harish have formed several kingdoms and empires within the savage lands through martial prowess and shrewd diplomacy. They are masters of war and trade, using their mighty militaries to keep trade routes safe from raiders. From their fortresses within the Wyrmtooth mountains they project order and structure deep across the deserts of the savage lands.</p>
