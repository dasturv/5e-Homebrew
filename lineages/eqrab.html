				Eqrab (Scorpions)
			</div>
			<em>Bongani peered through the sands with hatred. Not more than 30 sprigs away he could see the outsiders: one Elytran and two massive Harish warriors. No doubt coming to plunder the great mother for what little she had to give. Buried completely beneath the sand itself, he tapped and clicked quietly, communicating with his hunt-brothers, waiting for the perfect moment to pounce...</em>
			<br><br>

			<h3>A Dead God</h3>
			<p>The Eqrab were born upon the rolling dunes of the Savage Lands to a venomous god known as C'Tar. In ancient times their primordial father clashed with another god: The Great Wyrm, and while his venom eventually slew the great beast, C'tar himself was destroyed nearly entirely in the battle. His skeleton still stands tall as a sun bleached carapace deep within the desert.</p>

			<h3>Masters of the Desert</h3>
			<p>The Eqrab are the true masters of the sands. Living nomadically as hunter gatherers, they know the desert like no other. Calling it the Great Mother, they revere the landscape itself as a harsh but nurturing force. They keep in-depth oral histories of seasonal rivers, places where temporary wells can be found, the migration paths of prey animals and ways to procure and prepare tough desert plants for food.</p>

			<h3>Pragmatic Traditionalists</h3>
			<p>The Eqrab live in a harsh world where survival is never guaranteed. As such, most would be considered cold at best by the bugs at large, with difficult decisions to leave behind a wounded tribe mate or who gets to eat and who doesn't being common for the Eqrab. As an extension of this, the Eqrab deeply revere wisdom and experience, with elders and storytellers being held in high regard. For an Eqrab clan, having an elder with experiences from lean times can be the difference between holding on to life or a tribe dying out.</p>

			<h3>Reluctant Outcasts</h3>
			<p>It is rare for an Eqrab to leave their desert home, with most caring little about what occurs beyond the dunes. Those who do leave are most often exiles or survivors from decimated tribes, and most long to return to the rolling sands of their home. The few who do leave will often find themselves confused in a world alien to them, with vast greenery and even solid ground being confusing at best and disturbing at worst.</p>

			<h3>Eqrab Names</h3>
			<p>Eqrab names are most often passed down from generation to generation, with passing elders granting their names to the newer generations in hope of inspiring their survival. Eqrab tribe names are said to have come from the Great Mother, with many taking names representing plants, animals and phenomenom native to their desert home.</p>
			<p><strong>Eqrab Names:</strong> Abebe, Bonlanle, Chibuzo, Funanya, Isoba, Nneka, Onyeka, Thabo<br>
			<strong>Eqrab Tribe Names:</strong> Brokenbone, Darknight, Dewspine, Dunespider, Eartheater, Lielight, Shiftingsand, Thornypear</p>
