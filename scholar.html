			<br><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier
			<br><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifer per scholar level after 1st</p>

			<ul>
				<li>(a) a shortsword or (b) a light crossbow and 20 bolts</li>
				<li>(a) a scholar's pack or (b) an explorer's pack</li>
				<li>any simple weapon</li>
				<li>a set of leather armor</li>
				<li>any two tools of your choice</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Alternatively, if you are using starting gold, you start with 4d4x10 gp.</p>
			<h3>Academic Superiority</h3>
			<p>At first level you know how to apply your studies in practical ways known as maneuvers. You maneuvers are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.</p>
			<p><strong>Maneuvers.</strong> You learn two <a href="scholar_maneuvers.html">maneuvers</a> of your choice. Many maneuvers enhance an attack, dice roll or action in some way. You can only use one maneuver per attack, roll or triggering action. You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 3rd, 6th, 11th and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one. Some maneuvers cannot be learned unless you are part of a specific Scholarly Pursuit.</p>
			<p><strong>Superiority Dice.</strong> You have a number of superiority dice as shown in the Superiority Dice column of the Scholar class table, which are d6s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p><strong>Saving Throws.</strong> Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
			<p><strong>Maneuver Save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
			<h3>Critical Analysis</h3>
			<p>Also at 1st level, you are able to analyze both friends and foes alike in order to develop a plan to best help or hamper them. As a bonus action on your turn you can analyze a target within 60 feet of you. This analysis lasts one minute, until you analyze another target or until you are incapacitated. When you attack your analyzed target with a finesse or ranged weapon you can use your Intelligence modifer, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p>Additionally, once per turn when you expend a superiority die on a maneuver that targets your analyzed target, you may add your proficiency bonus to the roll.</p>
			<h3>Discoveries</h3>
			<p>In your continued studies you have made several <a href="scholar_discoveries.html">Discoveries</a>, a set of unique practices or insights you can apply to your adventuring.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, you make two discoveries of your choice. When you gain certain scholar levels, you gain additional discoveries of your choice, as shown in the Discoveries Made column of the Scholar table. A level preresiquite refers to your level in this class.</p>
			<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the discoveries you know and replace it with another discovery that you could learn at that level.</p>
			<h3>Sudden Insight</h3>
			<p>Beginning at 2nd level, you are able to apply your broad knowledge and deductive reasoning to gain insight in a skill or tool, even if your are not trained with it. As an action, you can choose one skill or tool that you lack proficiency in. For the next minute, you have proficiency in the chosen skill or tool. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>
			<p>You can use this feature twice between short or long rests starting at 14th level.</p>
			<h3>Expertise</h3>
			<p>At 3rd level, choose two of your skill or tool proficiencies, in any combination. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>
			<p>At 9th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with tools) to gain this benefit.</p>
			<h3>Scholarly Pursuit</h3>
			<p>At 3rd level, you choose a scholarly pursuit, a further specialization of your studies. The pursuit you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th and 17th level.</p>
			<table class="content-table">

			<h3>Ability Score Increase</h3>
			<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
			<h3>Improved Academic Superiority</h3>
			<p>Starting at 5th level, your superiority dice turn into d8s. Additionally, they turn into d10s at 10th level, and d12s at 15th level.</p>	
			<h3>Improved Critical Analysis</h3>
			<p>By 5th level, you are so skilled with analyzing your foes that you can even further exploit their weaknesses. Once per turn, when you roll to deal damage using a weapon or restore hit points to a target analyzed by your Critical Analysis feature, you can add 1d6 to that roll.</p>
			<p>This bonus increases to 2d6 at 11th level and 3d6 at 17th level.</p>
			<h3>Predictive Analysis</h3>
			<p>Also at 5th level, you analysis of your foes is so complete that you begin to predict their attacks. Whenever a creature analyzed by your Critical Analysis feature makes an attack roll targeting you, you gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to your Intelligence modifier for that attack.</p>	
			<h3>Quick Reflexes</h3>
			<p>By 7th level, you have developed greater reflexes. You gain proficiency in Dexterity saving throws.</p>
			<h3>Reliable Talent</h3>
			<p>By 13th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>
			<h3>Masterful Execution</h3>
			<p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to pour even more of your genius into your maneuvers. Once per turn, when you would expend a superiority die on a maneuver, you can expend one additional superiority die and add it to the total.</p>
			<h3>Calculated Defense</h3>
			<p>Beginning at 15th level, whenever you make a saving throw against an effect you can see, you gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>
			<h3>Lightning Execution</h3>
			<p>Beginning at 18th level, you may take one additional reaction per round. You may only use one reaction per trigger.</p>
			<h3>Genius Unbound</h3>
			<p>By 20th level, your genius has no equal. Your Intelligence score increases by 4. Your maximum for that score is now 24. Additionally, you may use any maneuver you know without expending a superiority die, rolling a d6 instead.</p>
