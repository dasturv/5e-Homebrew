				Pugilist: Dog and Hound
			</div>
			<p>
				<strong><em>
					For those who follow the fight club of the Dog and Hound, there has never been someone trustworthy who walked on two legs. Lucky for these pugilists, they have the best four legged friend anybody could ask for. Pugilists of the Dog and Hound are as faithful to their canine companions as their hounds are to them.
				</em></strong>
				<h3>Brawler's Best Friend</h3>
				<p>Starting at 3rd level, you gain a hound that accompanies you on your adventures and fights alongside you. It is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the Hound stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You determine what breed of dog, or similar canine creature, your hound is; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.</p>
				<p>In combat, the hound shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the hound can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge, focusing on protecting you and itself.</p>
				<p>If the hound has died within the last hour, you can revive it by coaxing it back from the threshold with praise and pets. As an action you can expend a number of hit dice equal to half your pugilist level to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it. The hound returns to life after 1 minute with all of its hit points restored. If your hound dies or is otherwise unavailable to you, you can forge a bond with a dog over 8 hours to become your new hound, ending your connection with your previous one.</p>

				<h3>Mutt with Moxie</h3>
				<p>Also starting at 3rd level, you share everything with your faithful hound: food, shelter, even moxie. When you use certain moxie features, your hound gains a benefit as well.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Brace Up.</strong> When you gain temporary hit points as a result of using your Brace Up moxie feature, your hound gains the same number of temporary hitpoints as you do. Any left over temporary hit points gained this way are lost at the start of your next turn.</li>
					<li><strong>The Old One-Two.</strong> When you use the Old One-Two moxie feature, your hound can use its reaction to make one or both attacks instead of you.</li>
					<li><strong>Stick and Move.</strong> When you use the Stick and Move moxie feature, your hound can use its reaction to either move up to its speed or force a creature within 5 feet of it to make a Strength saving throw against your moxie save DC, with the target falling prone on failure.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Old Dog, New Tricks</h3>
				<p>By 6th level, your hound companion has picked up on some of your tricks, expanding its options.</p>
				<p><strong>Deep Digger.</strong> As a bonus action you can expend 2 moxie point to allow your hound to regain 1d6 + your proficiency bonus hit points, provided it is within 5 feet of you.</p>
				<p><strong>Hound-maker.</strong> Whenever your hound makes a melee attack, you can declare the attack to be a haymaker. The hound has disadvantage on the attack roll, and if the attack hits, it deal the maximum result of the weapon's damage die instead of rolling.</p>
				<p><strong>Moxie-Fueled Jaws.</strong> Your hound's bite attack counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.</p>
				<h3>Unbow-wowed</h3>
				<p>Beginning at 11th level, your hound's tenacity almost matches your own. When your hound takes damage that reduces it to half its hit point maximum or less, it may use its reaction to regain hit points equal to three times your pugilist level. Additionally, it adds your proficiency bonus to the damage of its attacks for the next minute. This feature ends early if your hound becomes incapacitated. Once your hound uses this feature, it cannot use it again until it completes a long rest.</p>
				<h3>Off the Leash</h3>
				<p>By 17th level, your connection with your hound companion runs so deep that you can fight in tandem even without giving any commands. As a bonus action you can expend 5 moxie points to let your hound Off the Leash. While off the leash, your hound can take the attack action on its turn without requiring a command. Additionally while Off the Leash, your hound can attack twice, instead of once, whenever it takes the Attack action. This feature lasts for one minute or until you or your hound becomes incapacitated. Once you use this feature you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
