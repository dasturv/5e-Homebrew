				Scholar: Politician
			</div>
			<p>
				<strong><em>
					For some, influencing others is far more science than art, and this rings true more than ever for scholars of the Politician pursuit. Such scholars seek to master all ways to get others to do as they please, through flattery, charm, insults and intimidation. Whether beguiling ally or venomous foe, a scholar of the Politician pursuit is a potent force.
				</em></strong>
				<h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3>
				<p>When you choose this pursuit at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Deception, History, Insight, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion.</p>
				<p>Additionally, you gain proficiency with Calligrapher's Tools and learn two languages of your choice.</p>
				<h3>Insightful Analysis</h3>
				<p>Also at 3rd level, a creature under the effects of your Critical Analysis feature has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws against your maneuvers.</p>
				<h3>Inspirational Support</h3>
				<p>Beginning at 6th level, whenever another creature would add one or more of your superiority dice to an ability check, attack roll or saving throw, they can roll one of those dice twice and keep either roll.</p>
				<h3>Broad Appeal</h3>
				<p>Starting at 10th level, whenever you use a maneuver that requires a target to make a Wisdom saving throw, you can choose an additional creature within 30 feet of you. That creature must also make the Wisdom saving throw, and is effected as if it was the target of the maneuver if it fails. The second creature does not take any damage from the maneuver.</p>
				<h3>Beguiling Influence</h3>
				<p>By 17th level, your mastery over the hearts and minds of others is so complete that you can both sway a crowd with only a few words. As an action you can choose any number of creatures within 30 feet of you, provided those creatures can hear and understand you. Each of those creatures must make a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver save DC or be Frightened or Charmed by you for one minute. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature under the effects of your Critical Analysis feature has disadvantage on the initial save.</p>
				<p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
