				Pugilist: Arena Royale

			<p>
				<strong><em>
					For a pugilist who seeks to emulate the Arena Royale, fighting isn't just about beating up the other guy, it's about the show. They know better than most that you don't really win unless you get the crowd or populace on your side, and as such, they are masters of winning people over. Oftentimes carefully maintaining a public persona, complete with flashy signature moves and a winning smile, a follower of the Arena Royale takes the artistry of fighting very seriously.

				<h3>Signature Move</h3>
				<p>When you choose this fight club at 3rd level, you develop a signature move. Choose a signature move from the options below. You can expend 2 moxie points to use your signature move, provided you meet it's requirements. Once you've used your signature move you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>
				<p><strong>Bull Rush.</strong> As an action you make a special unarmed strike attack against a creature within your reach, provided you have moved at least 15 feet in a straight line towards the target this turn. If the attack hits, the creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to five rolls of your Fisticuffs die plus your Strength modifier and must make a Strength saving throw against your moxie save DC. On a failed save the target is pushed up to 10 feet away from you and is knocked prone.</p>
				<p><strong>Elbow Drop.</strong> As an action you make a special unarmed strike attack against a prone creature within your reach. If the attack hits, the creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to five rolls of your Fisticuffs die plus your Strength modifier and must make a Constitution saving throw against your moxie save DC. On a failed save the target is stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>
				<p><strong>Suplex.</strong> As an action you make a special unarmed strike attack against a creature that you have grappled. That creature must make a Dexerity saving throw against your moxie save DC, taking bludgeoning damage equal to six rolls of your Fisticuffs die plus your Strength modifier on a failed save and half as much on a successful one. Regardless of the save, your grapple on that creature ends.</p>
				<h3>Winning Smile</h3>
				<p>Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Performance skill. If you are already proficient in the Performance skill, you instead gain proficiency in the Persuasion or Intimation skill.</p>
				<h3>Work the Crowd</h3>
				<p>Starting at 6th level, you can use an action to attempt to charm those around you. When you do, creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you that can see and hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your moxie save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute. A creature can repeat this save at the end of each of its turns or whenever you deal damage to it, ending the charmed effect on a success.</p>
				<p>Once you use this feature you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest or expend 3 moxie points to use it again.</p>
				<h3>Save Face</h3>
				<p>Beginning at 11th level, you've learned how to avoid embarassing stumbles. Whenever you would make an attack roll or ability check with disadvantage, you can spend 1 moxie point to ignore that source of disadvantage for that roll.</p>
				<h3>Finishing Move</h3>
				<p>By 17th level you have developed and even flashier and deadlier signature move. Choose a finishing move from the options below. You can expend 4 moxie points to use you finishing move, provided you meet it's requirements. Once you've used your finishing move you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
				<p><strong>Eagle Strike.</strong> As an action you can fly up to your movement speed without provoking opportunity attacks. At the end of this movement you can make a special unarmed strike attack against a creature within your reach, provided you have moved at least 15 feet in a straight line towards the target this turn. If the attack hits, the creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to seven rolls of your Fisticuffs die plus your Strength modifier and must make a Strength saving throw against your moxie save DC. On a failed save the target is pushed up to 15 feet away from you and is knocked prone.</p>
				<p><strong>Guillotine.</strong> As an action you make a special unarmed strike attack against a prone creature within your reach. If the attack hits, the creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to seven rolls of your Fisticuffs die plus your Strength modifier and must make a Constitution saving throw against your moxie save DC. On a failed save the target is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>
				<p><strong>Skullbreaker.</strong> As an action you make a special unarmed strike attack against a creature that you have grappled.
