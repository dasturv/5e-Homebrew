			<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per pugilist level
			<br><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier
			<br><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifer per pugilist level after 1st</p>

			<ul>
				<li>(a) leather armor or (b) any simple weapon</li>
				<li>(a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack</li>
				<li>(a) a set of artisan's tools or (b) a gaming set</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Alternatively, if you are using starting gold, you start with 2d4x10 gp</p>
			<h3>Fisticuffs</h3>
			<p>At 1st level, your years of fighting in back alley brawls and fighting pits have given you mastery over combat styles that use unarmed strikes and pugilist weapons, which are any simple melee weapons or improvised melee weapon without the two-handed property. You cannot use the finesse property of a weapon while using it as a pugilist weapon.</p>
			<p>You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or using only pugilist weapons and you are wearing light or no armor and not using a shield:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or pugilist weapon. This die changes as you gain pugilist levels, as shown in the Fisticuffs column of the Pugilist table.</li>
				<li>When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or pugilist weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Iron Chin</h3>
			<p>Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 12 + your Constitution modifier.</p>
			<h3>Moxie</h3>
			<p>Starting at 2nd level, your experience laying the beatdown on others has given you a moxie you can channel in the midst of battle. This swagger is represented by a number of moxie points. your pugilist level determines how many points you have, as shown in the Moxie Points column of the Pugilist table.</p>
			<p>You can spend these points to fuel various moxie features. you start knowing three such features: Brace Up, The Old One-Two, and Stick and Move. You learn more moxie features as you gain levels in this class. you regain all expended moxie points when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p>Some of your moxie features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. the saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
			<p><strong>Moxie save DC:</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Brace Up.</strong> You can use a bonus action and spend 1 moxie point to brace for attacks. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to a roll of your fisticuffs die + your pugilist level + your Constitution modifier. You lose any remaining temporary hit points gained this way at the start of your next turn.</li>
				<li><strong>The Old One-Two.</strong> Immediately after you take the attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 moxie point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</li>
				<li><strong>Stick and Move.</strong> you can spend 1 moxie point to take the shove or dash action as a bonus action on your turn.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Street Smart</h3>
			<p>Beginning at 2nd level, carousing, shadowboxing and sparring all count as light activity for the purposes of resting for you.</p>
			<p>In addition, choose one of your skill proficiencies. your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make using the chosen skill.</p>
			<h3>Bloodied but Unbowed</h3>
			<p>Starting at 3rd level, when you take damage that reduces you to half your hit point maximum or less, you may use your reaction to regain hit points equal to three times your pugilist level as well as regain all expended moxie points. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
			<p>You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 18th level.</p>
			<h3>Pugilist Fight Club</h3>
			<p>At 3rd level, you choose a fight club that best exemplifies your style. The fight club you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th and 17th level.</p>

			<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
			<h3>Dig Deep</h3>
			<p>Also at 4th level, as an action, you can spend 2 moxie points and roll a Fisticuffs die. You regain a number of hit points equal to the number rolled plus your Constitution modifier.</p>
			<h3>Extra attack</h3>
			<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>
			<h3>Haymaker</h3>
			<p>Starting at 5th level, when you make an attack using an unarmed strike or pugilist weapon, you can declare you are swinging a wild haymaker. When you do, you have disadvantage on the attack roll, and if the attack hits, you deal the maximum result of the weapon's damage die instead of rolling.</p>
			<h3>Moxie Fueled Fists</h3>
			<p>Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.</p>

			<p>Additionally, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing medium or heavy armor or wielding a shield.</p>

			<p>Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.</p>
			<h3>Down But Not Out</h3>
			<p>Beginning at 9th level, when you use your Bloodied but Unbowed feature, you add your proficiency bonus to the damage of your unarmed strikes and pugilist weapons for the next minute. This feature ends early if you become incapacitated.</p>
			<h3>School of Hard Knocks</h3>
			<p>By 10th level, you have graduated top of the class in the school of hard knocks. You gain resistance to psychic damage and have advantage on saving throws against effects that would make you stunned or unconsious.</p>
			<h3>Prime Specimen</h3>
			<p>At 13th level, your impeccable physique grants you a certain charm. Whenever you make an Charisma(persuasion) or Charisma(intimidation) check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of +1).</p>
			<h3>Unbreakable</h3>
			<p>Starting at 14th level, you gain advantage on Strength, Dexterity and Constitution saving throws. Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 moxie point to reroll the save and take the second roll.</p>
			<h3>Herculean</h3>
			<p>Beginning at 15th level, your carrying capacity is doubled and whenever you deal damage with a melee weapon or unarmed strike to an inanimate object, that damage is doubled. Additionally, your standing jump distance is the same as your running jump distance.</p>
			<h3>Peak Condition</h3>
			<p>At 20th level, your Strength and Constitution ability scores increase by 2, to a maximum of 22. In addition, whenever you complete a long rest, your exhaustion level, if any, is decreased by 2 instead of 1 and you regain all of your expended hit dice instead of half.</p>
