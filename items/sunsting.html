			<p><em>Weapon (spear), artifact (requires attunement)</em></p>
			<p>This spear is wielded by the demigod Erenus, Champion of Evenala and Field Marshall for the Order of the Dawn. The spear appears as an intangible beam of light in the shape of a broad-headed spear.</p>

			<p><strong>Immortal Weapon.</strong> The spear is considered to be an immortal source for the purposes of overcoming damage and magic resistances.</p>

			<p><strong>Searing Radiance.</strong> The spear grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using this spear, the target takes an extra 2d8 radiant damage. This damage increases to 3d8 while the spear has more than 5 charges. Additionally, the spear has a range of 60/180 feet, and returns to your hand immediately returns to your hand in a flash of light after hitting or missing a target when thrown.</p>

			<p><strong>Intangible.</strong> A a bonus action you can summon the spear to your hand in a flash of light, provided you have a free hand. You can also banish the spear (no action required), which disappears into its own demiplane until you use your bonus action to summon it again. If you un-attune to the spear while it is banished, it appears within 5 feet of you in an unoccupied space.</p>

			<p><strong>Holy Light.</strong> The spear sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. This light is considered sunlight. Both of these radii increase by 1 foot for each charge the spear has.</p>

			<p><strong>Overcharge.</strong> The spear becomes violently unstable as it is used. The spear has 0 charges. Some abilities of the spear add or remove charges. The spear loses all charges once every day at dawn.</p>
			<p>At the start of each of your turns, if the spear has more than 5 charges, roll a d20. If the number rolled is equal to or less than the number of charges on the spear, it erupts in holy radiance. Each creature (including you) within a number of feet of you equal to five time the number of charges must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 1d10 radiant damage for each charge or half as much on a success. Once the spear erupts this way, it loses all of its charges and you cannot use any features that add charges to the spear until the next dawn.</p>
			<p>The following are features that add charges to the spear.</p>

			<ul>
			<li><strong>The Sun Cleanses Thee! (1 charge)</strong> Whenever you hit a creature with an attack using the spear, you can add 1 charge to the spear to end one spell that is 5th level or lower or a magical effect on that creature.</li>
			<li><strong>None Escape the Light! (2 charges)</strong> As a bonus action you let out a divine challenge. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or fall for your challenge for one minute. While challenged, a creature has disadvantage on attack rolls on creatures other than you and cannot willingly move more than 30 feet away from you. The creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This effect ends on a creature if you are ever 30 or more feet away from it.</li>
			<li><strong>The Sun Pierces Thee! (1 charge)</strong> You replace one of your attacks with a special attack using the spear. You throw the spear at a target within 300 feet. The target must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or take 6d8 radiant damage and be blinded until the start of your next turn. On a success a target takes half damage and isn't blinded. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw. The spear immediately returns to your hand after the attack.</li>
			<li><strong>For the Queen! (2 charges)</strong> As a bonus action you let out a rallying cry. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you gain 15 temporary hit points. While a creature has these hit points they have advantage on saving throws.</li>
			</ul>
