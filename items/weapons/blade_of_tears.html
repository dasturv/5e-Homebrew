				Blade of Tears
			</div>
			<p><em>Weapon (Mantis-claw), artifact (requires attunement)</em></p>
			<p>This legendary curved sword was forged from the blood red sap of Hinoki, the Divine Tree of Peace, in ancient times by the Kamakri demigod Tamotsu. He sliced at the tree and gathered her sap to create a weapon worthy of himself, though over time he began to commune with the Goddess. Through her guidance he poured his bloodlust into the sword, and once it was complete he no longer desired war. Casting the sword aside in order to pursue enlightenment, Tamotsu founded the race of the Blossom Kamakri. The sword itself is seen as both sacred relic and blasphemeous reminder of their original sin by the Blossom Kamakri.</p>

			<p><strong>Immortal Weapon.</strong> The sword is considered to be an immortal source for the purposes of overcoming damage and magic resistances.</p>

			<p><strong>Keen.</strong> The sword grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using this sword, the target takes an extra 1d8 slashing damage. This damage increases by 1d8 while the sword has 4 or more charges.</p>

			<p><strong>Vicious.</strong> When you attack with the sword, you score a critical hit on a 19 or 20. Additionally, whenever you score a critical hit on a creature with the sword, you deal and additional 1d8 slashing damage for each charge on the sword.</p>

			<p><strong>Growing Bloodlust.</strong> The sword has 0 charges. Whenever you score a critical hit on a creature or reduce a creature to 0 hit points using the sword, it gains 1 charge to a maximum of 8. Whenever you add a charge to the sword you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 17 + the number of charges on the sword) or become enraged for one minute. At the start of each of your turns while enraged this way you must move towards a random creature you can see and reach using your movement, and then must use all of your attacks to attack that creature. Another creature can attempt to calm you down while you are enraged, using their action to allow you to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on yourself on a success.</p>

			<p><strong>Quell Bloodlust.</strong> As an action you can make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 17 + the number of charges on the sword) to attempt to quell the sword's violent nature. On a success you reduce the number of charges on the sword by 1d4. On a failure you become enraged for one minute. Each day at dawn if you had not used the sword to attack another creature since the previous dawn, it loses all charges.</p>
