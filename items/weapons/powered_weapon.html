				Power Weapon
			</div>
			<p><em>Weapon (any), common</em></p>
			<p>The weapon is modified to use minor flux cells, granting it magical capabilities based on what type of weapon it is. The weapon can hold one minor flux cell, which provides 20 charges. Replacing the cell takes a bonus action.</p>
			<p><strong>Melee Weapons.</strong> A melee power weapon deals force damage instead of its normal damage type, provided it has at least one charge. Whenever you deal damage using the weapon, it expends one charge.</p>
			<p><strong>Ranged Weapons.</strong> A ranged power weapon deals force damage instead of its normal damage type. Additionally the weapon loses the ammunition property. Instead, whenever you attack with the weapon it expends one charge to create a magical piece of ammunition, provided it has at least one charge. This magical ammunition dissipates immediately upon hitting or missing its target. Powered ranged weapons cannot use normal ammunition.</p>
			<p><strong>Arcane Charging <em>(Optional).</em></strong> In settings without flux cells or an equivalent source of energy, power weapons can be instead charged by spellcasters. As an action a creature can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to restore 20 charges for the weapon. The weapon can only have up to 20 charges.</p>
