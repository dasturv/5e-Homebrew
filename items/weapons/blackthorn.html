			<p><em>Weapon (greataxe), artifact (requires attunement)</em></p>
			<p>This greataxe was once wielded by the Karhuvaki barbarian, Bjorn Eldersbane. The axe appears to be carved entirely from the pale horn of a colossal beast. Long bone spikes grow from the back and sides of the weapon, and black scales still cling to it's base.</p>

			<p><strong>Dormant.</strong> While in its dormant state, the axe grants the following benefits:</p>
			<ul><li>Whenever you score a critical hit with this magical axe, the target takes an additional 5 piercing damage.</li></ul>
			<p><strong>Stirring.</strong> When the axe reaches a stirring state, it gains the following properties:</p>
			<ul><li>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. On a hit, the weapon deals an additional 1d6 piercing damage.</li>
			<li>The axe has 10 spines. You can expend one spine to replace one of your attacks with the axe with special ranged attack that deals 1d6 piercing damage and has a range of 30/120. You use your strength for this attack and apply any modifiers to attack and damage rolls from the axe to this ranged attack. The axe regrows all of its spines each day at dawn.</li></ul>

			<p><strong>Awakened.</strong> While in its awakened state, the axe grants the following benefits:</p>
			<ul><li>The axe's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to a +2. Additionally, the additional piercing damage damage increases to 2d6.</li>
			<li>The axe now has 15 spines. Whenever you get hit with an attack by a creature within 5 feet of you, you can expend 2 spines to deal 2d6 piercing damage to that creature.</li></ul>

			<p><strong>Exalted.</strong> While in its exalted state, the axe grants the following benefits:</p>
			<ul><li>The axe's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to a +3. Additionally, the additional piercing damage damage increases to 3d6.</li>
			<li>The axe now has 25 spines. Whenever you score a critical hit with the weapon, you can expend 3 spines to deal an additional 3d6 necrotic damage and regain hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.</li></ul>
