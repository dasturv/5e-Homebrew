			</div>
			<p><em>Weapon (maul), rarity varies (requires attunement)</em></p>
			<p>This maul is cold to the touch and is covered in a thin layer of frost.</p>

			<p><strong>Slumbering (Uncommon).</strong> Whenever you score a critical hit on a creature with this weapon, the target's movement speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.</p>

			<p><strong>Stirring (Rare).</strong> The Stirring hammer has the Slumbering property. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the hammer. On a hit, the hammer deals an extra 1d8 cold damage.</p>

			<p><strong>Wakened (Very Rare).</strong> The Wakened weapon has the Slumbering property, and it improves on the Stirring property. The bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2.</p>
			<p>As an action, you can unleash a 30-foot cone of destructive energy from the weapon. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 4d6 cold damage and 4d6 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Objects and structures take double damage from this feature. Once this action is used, it canâ€™t be used again until the next dawn.</p>

			<p><strong>Ascendant (Legendary).</strong> The Ascendant weapon has the Slumbering property, and it improves on the Stirring and Wakened properties. The bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3.</p>
			<p>The cone of destructive energy the weapon creates increases to a 60-foot cone, the save DC increases to 18, and the damage increases to 6d6 cold and thunder damage.</p>
