			<p><em>Wondrous Item, uncommon (Requires Attunement)</em></p>
			<p>This odd machine is designed to be held in two hands. Lights of constantly shifting hues radiate from within the machine.</p>
			<p><strong>Flux Powered.</strong> The machine requires flux power cells to function. Each cell provides 7 charges. It takes one action to replace the cell in the machine.</p>
			<p><strong>Flux Orb.</strong> As an action you can expend at least one charge to cast the <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:chromatic-orb">Chromatic Orb</a> spell using the machine. The spell is cast at 1st level (Spell attack bonus +5), and deals a random damage type based on the table below. For each charge expended beyond the first, you can increase the spell level or attack bonus by 1.</p>
			<p><strong>Malfunction.</strong> Each time you attempt to cast a spell using the machine, roll a d10. If the roll is less than the number of charges the machine has expended since you last completed a long rest, the machine catastrophically malfunctions, releasing all of its energy in a bright flash of light. The spell is not cast, and instead all creatures within 20 feet of you (including you) must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 13 plus the number of charges the machine still has) or be blinded for one minute. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. After malfunctioning, the machine's energy cell is drained and the machine cannot be used again until it is repaired as part of a long rest (requires proficiency with tinker's tools).</p>
