			<p><em>Wondrous Item, rare (Requires Attunement)</em></p>
			<p>This odd machine is designed to be held in two hands. Multiple brass pipes converge towards its end, where a small flame burns. The machine is constantly mildly hot to the touch.</p>
			<p><strong>Flux Powered.</strong> The machine requires greater flux power cells to function. Each cell provides 7 charges. It takes one complex action to replace the cell in the machine.</p>
			<p><strong>Flux Mortar.</strong> As an action you can expend at least one charge to cast the <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:fireball">Fireball</a> spell using the machine. The spell is cast at 3rd level (Save DC 15). For each charge expended beyond the first, you can increase the spell level or attack bonus by 1.</p>
			<p><strong>Malfunction.</strong> Each time you attempt to cast a spell using the machine, roll a d10. If the roll is less than the number of charges the machine has expended since you last completed a long rest, the machine catastrophically malfunctions, releasing all of its energy in a devastating explosion. The spell is not cast, and instead all creatures within 20 feet of you (including you) must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15 plus the number of charges the machine still has) or take 1d10 fire damage for each remaining charge (including the charges used to cast the spell). After malfunctioning, the machine's energy cell is drained and the machine cannot be used again until it is repaired as part of a long rest (requires proficiency with tinker's tools).</p>
