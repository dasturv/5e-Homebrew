				Infernal Coin Purse
			</div>
			<p><em>Wondrous Item, uncommon</em></p>
			<p>This unassuming dark leather pouch is enchanted with foul magics connecting it to the Nine Hells. When found, the purse contains 1d4-1 infernal coins. Whenever the holder of the coin purse reduces a sentient humanoid creature to 0 hit points using a <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:hellfire-weapon">hellfire weapon</a> or another source of hellfire, one coin appears in the coin purse, to a maximum of nine coins.</p>
			<p>As an action, a creature may take a coin from the purse and siphon the contained soul's essence, gaining 1d10 temporary hit points. Doing so destroys the coin, which rusts to dust within moments after use, and frees the soul it contains.</p>
			<p>The coin purse is an evil object, and to use it is to hear the torment and rage of the souls trapped within it. An evil creature may use the coin purse without detriment, but any non-evil creature has  disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws and ability checks while holding the purse or one of its coins.</p>
			<p>Destroying the coin purse or its coins are considered good actions, even if the trapped soul is evil. The coins have 1 hit point and an AC of 19, and are immune to all damage except from a source of hellfire. The coin purse has 10 hit points and an AC of 15, and is similarly immune to non-hellfire damage. The damage immunities of the coins and purse can be temporarily removed by sprinkling holy water on them, making them vulnerable for one minute.</p>
