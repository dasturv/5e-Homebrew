			<p><em>Wondrous Item, rarity varies</em></p>
			<p>A specialized form of thought gem, a cognigem is effectively an artificial mind, capable of reason, creativity and even emotions for some of the most advanced. Cognigems are widely used throughout Valastar as the basis for golems, artificial teachers and thinking machines.</p>
			<p><strong>Abilities and Skills.</strong> Every cognigem has a Wisdom, Intelligence and Charisma score, based on its rarity and function (see the table below for the available scores). In addition, cognigems can have skill and tool proficiencies and expertise, also based on their rarity. A cognigem installed in a machine that allows it to communicate can use its knowledge to help with skill checks (provided it can speak a language) and while in a golem body, can even act freely.</p>
