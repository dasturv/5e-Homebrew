				Bow of the Four Winds
			</div>
			<p><em>Weapon (longbow), artifact (requires attunement by a follower of Fujin)</em></p>
			<p>This longbow belonged to the wind god Fujin and was gifted to his follower, Illinean Song. Simply fashioned from a single branch of an sacred yew tree, the bow is covered in dozens of colorful strips of woven cloth, colorful beads and carved trinkets, all offerings to Fujin. The ornamentation changes over time when not observed.</p>
			<p><strong>Magic Weapon.</strong> The bow is a magic weapon that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using the bow, the target takes an additional 1d6 cold, fire, radiant or thunder damage (your choice). Attacks you make with the bow ignore disadvantage imposed by long range as well as ignores half and three-quarters cover.</p>
			<p>If you load no arrow into the weapon, it produces its own, automatically creating one magical arrow when you pull back the string. The arrow created by the bow vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.</p>
			<p><strong>Wind's Grace.</strong> While attuned to the Bow of the Four Winds, your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Additionally, your movement speed is increased by 10 feet.</p>
			<p><strong>Four Wind Arrow.</strong> The bow has 10 charges. Once on each of your turns, you can spend one of the bow's charges to replace one of your attacks with the bow with one of the special arrows below. The special arrow does not use ammunition, and does not require an attack roll. Each special arrow has a range of 150 feet and has a save DC of 17. The bow regains 1d4 charges four times a day, once at dawn, once at noon, once at dusk and once at midnight.</p>
			<ul><li><strong>East Wind Arrow.</strong> This arrow harnesses the life giving warmth of the east wind, and appears as a gentle beam of light. Choose a creature within range. That creature recovers 25 hit points.</li></ul>
			<ul><li><strong>North Wind Arrow.</strong> This arrow harnesses the biting cold of the north wind, and appears as an icicle cloaked in swirling snow. Choose a creature within range. That creature must make a Constitution saving throw or tale 4d8 cold damage and be frozen in place. A frozen creature has a movement speed of 0 and cannot benefit from increases to its speed. A creature can use their action to break themselves or another creature within 5 feet out of the ice. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half damage and is not frozen.</li></ul>
			<ul><li><strong>South Wind Arrow.</strong> This arrow harnesses the scorching heat of the east wind, and appears as a smoldering branch cloaked in heat distortions. Choose a point within range. Each creature within 15 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 fire damage on a failure and half that much on a success.</li></ul>
			<ul><li><strong>West Wind Arrow.</strong> This arrow harnesses the tempestuous force of the west wind, and appears as a bolt of lightning surrounded by roiling clouds. Choose a creature within range. That creature must make a Strength saving throw or take 6d6 thunder damage and be pushed 15 feet away from you. A creature that succeeds the saving throw takes half the damage and is not pushed.</li></ul>
