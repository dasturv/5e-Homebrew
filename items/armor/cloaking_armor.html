				Cloaking Armor
			</div>
			<p><em>Armor (any light armor), rare</em></p>
			<p>This strange armor is modified to generate a visual disruption field using an arcane mechanism on its back.</p>
			<p><strong>Flux Powered.</strong> The armor requires greater flux cells to function. Each cell provides 4 charges. It takes one complex action to replace the cell in the armor.</p>
			<p><strong>Cloaking.</strong> As an action while wearing the armor you can expend one charge to activate its disruption field. While the field is active, you have advantage on all Dexterity(Stealth) checks to not be seen, and creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. Additionally, you are considered invisible as long as you have moved half your movement speed or less, have not made an attack and have not casted a spell since the start of your last turn. The field lasts for for 1 minute or until you take damage.</p>
