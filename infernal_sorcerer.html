				Sorcerer: Infernal
			</div>
			<p>
				<strong><em>
					The Nine Hells and their fell heirachy are always seeking ways to influence the mortal planes, in order to collect more souls and sabotage their hated rivals. As such, there is much power and influence to be granted, and deals to be made. Some sorcerers are a product of these deals. Whether through dark rituals or sinister unions, such sorcerers wield the burning power of the Nine Hells as their birthright, bringing both hellish flames and unbreakable tyranny into the fray.
				</em></strong>

				<h3>Infernal Spells</h3>
				<p>Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Infernal Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.</p>

				<p>Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be a evocation or an enchantment spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.</p>

				<h3>Mark of the Pit</h3>
				<p>Also at 1st level you gain the ability to speak, read and write Infernal. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with Devils, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.</p>
				<h3>Hellfire Conduit</h3>
				<p>Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals fire damage, add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to allow spells you cast ignore fire resistance for the next hour.</p>
				<p>At 14th level, when you spend sorcery points this way, your spells also treat immunity to fire damage as resistance to fire damage for the next hour.</p>
				<h3>Blasphemous Transformation</h3>
				<p>Beginning at 14th level, you can unleash the infernal powers within yourself. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 or more sorcery points to magically transform your body for 10 minutes. For each sorcery point you spend, you can gain one of the following benefits of your choice, the effects of which last until the transformation ends:</p>
				<ul><li>You gain darkvision out to 120 feet, and you can see in both magical and non-magical darkness within this range. Your eyes glow faintly like flickering flames or smoldering coals.</li></ul>
				<ul><li>You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. You sprout either bat wings or black feathered wings from your back.</li></ul>
				<ul><li>You gain immunity to fire and poison damage, as well as the poisoned condition. Your skin grows scales or changes to a strange color.</li></ul>
				<ul><li>You gain proficiency in Intimidation checks and add double your proficiency to Charisma(Intimidation) checks. Your teeth grow into fangs, your grow horns and your tongue forks.</li></ul>
				<h3>Hellfire Mastery</h3>
				<p>By 18th level, your mastery over the flames of the Nine Hells is unrivaled. Whenever you cast a spell that deals fire damage, you can choose to deal the maximum damage for that spell instead of rolling. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
