				Scholar: Physician
			</div>
			<p>
				<strong><em>
					A physician is a healer first and foremost. With knowledge in fields such as anatomy, herbalism, toxicology and many more, a Physician leverages all mortal knowledge to fight against injuries and disease. While completely mundane, their understanding of life and death allows them to approach what the average person would consider miracles.
				</em></strong>
				<h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3>
				<p>When you choose this pursuit at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand.</p>
				<p>Additionally, you gain proficiency with Herbalism kits and Alchemist's Supplies.</p>
				<h3>Studied Healer</h3>
				<p>Also at 3rd level, your healing abilities are improved. Whenever you expend a superiority die to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains 2 additional hit points.</p>
				<p>At 11th level this bonus increases by a further 2 additional hit points (for a total of 4).</p>
				<h3>Frontline Medic</h3>
				<p>Beginning at 6th level, you are adept at surviving on the frontline where you are needed most. You are considered to have half cover when a friendly creature is within 5 feet of you, provided that creature is small size or larger and neither you nor that creature are incapacitated.</p>
				<p>Additionally, whenever a friendly creature leaves your reach, you can use your reaction to move up to your speed, provided you end that movement within 5 feet of that creature.</p>
				<h3>Resuscitate</h3>
				<p>Starting at 10th level, you have learned how to bring recently deceased creatures back to life. As an action you can touch a creature that has been dead for less than one minute. That creature is immediately returned back to life with 1 hit point. Once you use this feature you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
				<h3>Medical Mastery</h3>
				<p>By 17th level, your understanding of the medical sciences are unparalled. Whenever you would roll one or more superiority dice to restore hit points or grant temporary hit points to a creature, you instead use the highest number possible for each die.</p>
