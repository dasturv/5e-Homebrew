				Summon Lesser Devils
			</div>
			<p><em>3rd-level Conjuration</em></p>
			<p>
				<strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br>
				<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br>
				<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (powdered ruby dust worth at least 66 gp, which the spell consumes)<br>
				<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour<br>
			</p>
			<p>You utter dark words, summoning devils from the Nine Hells. Choose from the following options to determine what appears.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Two devils of challenge rating 1 or lower</li>
				<li>Four devils of challenge rating 1/2 or lower</li>
				<li>Eight devils of challenge rating 1/4 or lower</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You choose the devils and the unnoccupied spaces you can see within range where they appear. A summoned devil disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.</p>
			<p>The summoned devils are unfriendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned devils as a group, which has its own turns. On your turn, you can issue verbal commands to them (no action required by you). They obey the command if the likely outcome is in accordance with their desires, especially if the result would draw you toward evil. Otherwise, you must make a Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check contested by their Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check fails, the devils become immune to your verbal commands for the duration of the spell, though they can still carry out your commands if they choose. If your check succeeds, the devils carry out your command. If you don’t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. The DM has the creatures’ statistics.</p>
			<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 6th-level slot and three times as many with an 8th-level slot.</p>
			<p><strong>Spell Lists.</strong> Warlock, Wizard</p>
