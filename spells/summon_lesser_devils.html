				Summon Lesser Devils
			</div>
			<p><em>3rd-level Conjuration</em></p>
			<p>
				<strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br>
				<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br>
				<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (powdered ruby dust worth at least 66 gp, which the spell consumes)<br>
				<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour<br>
			</p>
			<p>You utter dark words, summoning devils from the Nine Hells. Choose from the following options to determine what appears.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Two devils of challenge rating 1 or lower</li>
				<li>Four devils of challenge rating 1/2 or lower</li>
				<li>Eight devils of challenge rating 1/4 or lower</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You choose the devils and the unnoccupied spaces you can see within range where they appear. A summoned devil disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.</p>
			<p>The devils are unfriendly towards you and your companions. Roll initiative for the devils as a group, which has its own turns. They are under the Dungeon Master’s control and acts according to their nature on each of their turns, which might result in them attacking you if they think they can prevail, or trying to tempt you to undertake an evil act in exchange for limited service. The DM has the creature’s statistics.</p>
			<p>On each of your turns, you can try to issue a verbal command to the devils (no action required by you). They obey the command if the likely outcome is in accordance with their desires, especially if the result would draw you toward evil. Otherwise, you must make a Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check contested by their Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check fails, the devils become immune to your verbal commands for the duration of the spell, though they can still carry out your commands if they choose. If your check succeeds, the devils carry out your command— such as “attack my enemies,” “explore the room ahead," or “bear this message to the queen"—until they complete the activity, at which point they return to you to report having done so.</p>
			<p>If your concentration ends before the spell reaches its full duration, the devils don't disappear if they have become immune to your verbal commands. Instead, they act in whatever manner they choose for 3d6 minutes, and then disappear.</p>
			<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th or 7th level, you summon twice as many devils. If you cast it using a spell slot of 8th or 9th level, you summon three times as many devils.</p>
