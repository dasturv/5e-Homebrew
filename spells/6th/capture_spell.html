			<p><em>6th-level Abjuration</em></p>

				<strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell<br>
				<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br>
				<strong>Components:</strong> S <br>
				<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous<br>
			</p>
			<p>You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell and steal its magical energies for yourself. If the creature is casting a spell of 6th level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 7th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the creature’s spell fails and has no effect.</p>
			<p>If you successfully cause a spell to fail using this spell, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than the level of the failed spell, and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>
			<p>If you are using the spell points variant rule and successfully cause a spell to fail using this spell, you recover a number of spent spell points equal to the spell point cost of the failed spell.</p>
			<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.</p>
			<p><strong>Spell Lists.</strong> Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard</p>
