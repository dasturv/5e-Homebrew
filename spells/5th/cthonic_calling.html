			<p>
				<strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute<br>

			<p>You utter a foul incantation words, summoning a yugoloth from the plane of Gehenna. You choose the yugoloth's type, which must be one of challenge rating 6 or lower, such as a mezzoloth. The yugoloth appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The yugoloth disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.</p>
			<p>The yugoloth is unfriendly toward you and your companions, but can be enticed to follow your commands. Roll initiative for the yugoloth, which has its own turns. It is under the Dungeon Master’s control and acts in self defense unless enticed to follow another creature's commands. The DM has the creature’s statistics.</p>
			<p>When you summon the yugoloth make a Charisma(Intimidation) or Charisma(Persuasion) check with the DC equal to 10 plue twice the yugoloth's challenge rating. This DC is reduced by 1 for each 100 gp worth of gold or treasure offered as part of casting this spell. On a success, the yugoloth obeys your commands (no action required by you) for the duration or until another creature successdully entices it to their service. On a failure, you can use an action on your turn to repeat this check, as long as you offer at least 100 gp worth of gold or treasure more than the last offering made to yugoloth (this can further reduce the DC of the check).</p>
			<p>As an action, a creature the yugoloth can see may attempt to entice the yugoloth to its service. The creature must offer an amount of gold or treasure of greater value than the last offering made to the yugoloth. The creature makes a Charisma(Intimidation) or Charisma(Persuasion) check with the DC equal to 10 plus twice the yugoloth's challenge rating. This DC is reduced by 1 for each 100 gp worth of gold or treasure offered. On a success, the yugoloth begins to follow the commands of only that creature (no action required).</p>
			<p>If your concentration ends before the spell reaches its full duration, the yugoloth doesn't disappear if it is following the commands of a hostile creature. Instead, it continues to follow that creature's commands for 3d6 minutes, and then it disappears.</p>
			<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.</p>
