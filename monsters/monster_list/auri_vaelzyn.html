				Auri Vaelzyn, the Gilded Lady
			</div>
			<p>The Gilded Lady is perhaps the individual with the greatest foresight of anyone in all of Valastar. Gifted with the ability to see the future, the ancient gold dragon Auri seeks to carefully guide the mortals of Valastar to a better tomorrow. Serving as an advisor to mortal politicians and founder of the Gilded Council, she patiently steers the matters of state towards an idealized future that only she can comprehend. Her advice is greatly sought after, though she usually prefers to listen rather than speak if she can. Being within her presence and listening to her wisdom is one of the most majestic and awe-inspiring experiences a mortal can have in Valastar.</p>

			<h3>Auri Vaelzyn's Lair</h3>
			<p>The Aerie Eternus is the meeting place of the Gilded Council, a coalition of ancient metallic dragons that seek to influence the politics of Valastar, with the upper levels also serving as Auri's personal lair. Unreachable without flight and vigilantly guarded by loyal draconic followers, Auri spends days at a time meditating in her gardens and libraries, seeking the best path of action to achieve a brighter future.</p>
			<h5>Lair Actions</h5>
			<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Auri takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; she can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Auri glimpses the future, so dhe has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until initiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
				<li>One creature Auri can see within 120 feet of herself must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a dream plane, a different plane of existence Auri has imagined into being. To escape, the creature must use its action to make a Charisma check contested by Auri’s. If the creature wins, it escapes the dream plane. Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count 20 on the next round. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Regional Effects</h5>
			<p>The region around Auri's lair is warped by her presence, creating the following effects:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Whenever a creature that can understand a language sleeps or enters a state of trance or reverie within 6 miles of Auri’s lair, she can establish telepathic contact with that creature and converse with it in its dreams. The creature remembers its conversation with her upon waking.</li>
				<li>Auri is aware of all creatures within 6 miles of the lair, and can cast Scrying on them without requiring a saving throw from the target.</li>
				<li>Locations and structures within 6 miles of the lair take on a dream-like, idealized form, always looking polished, vibrant and pristine.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If Auri dies, these effects end immediately.</p>
