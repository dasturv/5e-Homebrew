				Kuth Shevon, the Matriarch
			</div>
			<p>The Matriarch is a subtle and influential dragonlord. The least xenophobic of the dragonlords, Kuth has built her power through partnerships, allies, familial ties and working with the mortal creatures of Valastar. The Shevon clan of blue dragons have a claw in most major industries, guilds and political groups, a fact that is often as much a boon as a burden. These ties have made the Shevon clan far wealthier and influential than any individual dragonlord, but their complex interconnected needs make the clan slow and cautious to act. Despite her power, Kuth never openly declares herself greater than other dragonlords, a semblance of humility that has allowed her to become the primary diplomatic presence in the draconic realm.</p>

			<h3>Kuth Shevon's Lair</h3>
			<p>Kuth lairs within her estate, a large expanse of privately owned land in the upper warrens. Walled off from the public, giant crystal structures dot the estate, bringing sunlight down from the layers above. In the warm arid air, vast gardens of hardy desert plants and artificial streams are tended by mortal servants, with docile wildlife roaming throughout. In the center of the estate looms Kuth's manor, a massive sandstone structure made with subtle shades of earthy browns and subtle greens. Kuth spends many long days perched in one of her manor's many open air balconies, looking out over her estate.</p>
			<h5>Lair Actions</h5>
			<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Kuth takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; she can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The subtle enchantments of the lair converges on a creature Kuth can see within 120 feet of herself. The creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on istself on a success.</li>
				<li>A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point Kuth can see within 120 feet of herself. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
				<li>Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lairâ€™s solid surfaces that Kuth can see. They must be within 120 feet of her and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning damage.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Regional Effects</h5>
			<p>The region around Kuth's lair is warped by her presence, creating the following effects:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Wildlife within 6 miles of the lair are unnaturally docile, neither fleeing nor fighting back even if attacked.</li>
				<li>Water sources within 6 miles of the lair are enchanted. A creature who drinks from such a source must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or become indifferent to creatures it is hostile towards for 1 hour, as if it was under the effects of the <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:calm-emotions">Calm Emotions</a> spell.</li>
				<li>Plant leaves and fruits within 6 miles of the lair contain subtle toxins, and fills creatures with a mild euphoria. Whenever a creature consumes one of these plants they have disadvantage on all Wisdom(Insight) and Wisdom(Perception) checks for 1 hour.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If Kuth dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.</p>
