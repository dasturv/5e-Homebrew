				Ghul Zadi, the Voiceless One
			</div>
			<p>The most secretive and mysterious of the Dragonlords, Ghul Zadi dwells deep in the undercity, pulling the strings from the shadows below Valastar. Few have ever heard of Ghul, and even fewer have had direct dealings with the ancient black dragon. Only the highest ranking members of the Ebonfangs, a deadly order of assassins and spies, have ever laid eyes upon the dragonlord themselves, and none dare relate the experience. Ghul remains the secret master of dealing and overcoming death, with Valastars deadliest assassins and most depraved necromancers ultimately answering to it. Ghul does not control a territory beyond its lair unlike the other dragonlords, instead it prowls the undercity and other places where the light fails.</p>

			<h3>Ghul Zadi's Lair</h3>
			<p>The Pit, a vast chute a mile wide that descends from the Warrens deep into the undercity, is the closest thing Ghul Zadi has to a lair. Prowling silently and unseen amongst the piles of refuse cast down from above, swimming through fetid pools and burrowing into mountains of debris, Ghul rules over all that was lost. The few souls who dare to rummage through the waste tell tales of an invisible beast that stalks and kills greedy scavengers, with those who ignore such warnings serving as Ghul's dinner. The few who follow the dragonlord seek its guidance in this realm of decay and death, recieving fell instructions annd dark wisdom from their patron.</p>
