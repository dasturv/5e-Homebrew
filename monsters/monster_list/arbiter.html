				Arbiter
			</div>
			<p>The weakest but most prevelant form of Inevitable, the humble arbiter serves as a legal assistant and witness to mortal laws. Having an arbiter appear at a court hearing or treaty signing is often taken as a symbol of the moment's signifigance. An arbiter appears as a small floating orb, constructed from steel and brass. In the center of the orb is a single, large blue gem that serves as the arbiter's eye.</p>
			<p><strong>Arbiters as Familiars.</strong> On occasion, spellcasters may seek out arbiters as familiars. Often found alongside lawfully leaning spellcasters or those with high legal status in their society. An arbiter serves their master loyally, if apathetically. An arbiter familiar does their best to ensure their master follows the legal codes of the land they are in and urges them to honor their agreements. An arbiter that is abused or ignored will often leave their master, but not before reporting them to the proper authorities.</p>
