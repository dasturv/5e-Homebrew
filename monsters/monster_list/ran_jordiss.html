				Ran Jordiss, Lord of Fire
			</div>
			<p>Lord of Fire, leader of the Crimson Claws, sole proprietor of Jordiss Heavy Industries, the ancient red dragon Ran Jordiss has many titles. Ran is the undisputed ruler of the slag district within the forges, a region characterized by exposed molten stone and metal flowing freely and the constant sounds of heavy machinery. The district produces much of the raw materials Valastar relies on, a fact that keeps Ran's treasure hoard growing constantly. Ran is a fickle and often cruel boss, with little care for his employees and even less patience with them. His factories are some of the worse to work in across Valastar, but his immense wealth and stranglehold on important resources keeps authorities out of his domain. Despite his cruelty and greed, Ran is seen by the majority of the public as a cunning business owner and brilliant engineer, a fact hard to deny with the quality of machines coming from his factories.</p>

			<h3>Ran Jordiss' Lair</h3>
			<p>Deep within the slag district lies the Drakonfurge, Ran's personal lair. Spanning across a space larger than a dozen city blocks, the Drakonfurge's exterior is a solid metal wall on all sides, with the only entrances being submerged in molten metals. From within his lair Ran spends his time brooding upon his hoard and inventing new machines, away from the distractions of his pesky employees. The interior of his lair is made of a complex web of connected tunnels made of hot steel, cooled slag and studded with bits of heavy machinery.</p>
			<h5>Lair Actions</h5>
			<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Ran takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Molten metal erupts from a point on the ground Ran can see within 120 feet of himself, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.</li>
				<li>Ancient machinery whirs to life around Ran, causing the ground to shake in a 60-foot radius aroung him. Each creature other than Ran on the ground in that area must succeed a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</li>
				<li>Toxic gases spew from cracks annd vents in the walls, forming a 20-foot-radius sphere cloud centered on a point Ran can see within 120 feet of himself. The sphere spreads around corners and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the ned of its turn. While poisoned this way, a creature is incapacitated.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Regional Effects</h5>
			<p>The region around Ran's lair is warped by his presence, creating the following effects:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Small tremors and quakes are common within 6 miles of the lair.</li>
				<li>Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted by sulfur.</li>
				<li>Industrial machinery within 1 mile of the lair runs supernaturally quickly, but severe and lethal industrial accidents are far more common.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If Ran dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.</p>
