			<h3>Nej Falla's Lair</h3>
			<p>Lair Description</p>
			<h5>Lair Actions</h5>
			<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Nej takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; they can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Nej chooses a point on the ground that they can see within 120 feet of themself. Stone spikes sprout from the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that point. The effect is otherwise identical to the spike growth spell and lasts until Nej uses this lair action again or until they dies.</li>
				<li>Nej chooses a 10-foot-square area on the ground that they can see within 120 feet of themself. The ground in that area turns into 3-foot-deep mud. Each creature on the ground in that area when the mud appears must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or sink into the mud and become restrained. A creature can take an action to attempt a DC 16 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach and ending the restrained condition on a success. Moving 1 foot in the mud costs 2 feet of movement. On initiative count 20 on the next round, the mud hardens, and the Strength DC to work free increases to 21.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Regional Effects</h5>
			<p>The region around Nej's lair is warped by their presence, creating the following effects:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Effect 1</li>
				<li>Effect 2</li>
				<li>Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of Nej’s lair are prone to fits of giggling. Even serious matters suddenly seem amusing.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If Nej dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.</p>
