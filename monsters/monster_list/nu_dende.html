				Nu Dende, the Lifegiver
			</div>
			<p>In all of Valastar, none understand the balance between life and death like Nu Dende. Nearly all medicinal compounds (and illicit drugs) can trace their origins to the ancient green dragon's gardens. In addition, the cunning dragonlord also has the market of nutrigruel cornered, making nearly every citizen of the lower levels reliant on him and his products. Nu acts with subtlety and tact, working continuously to maintain his public image as a brilliant doctor and gracious business owner. And while his views on the general populace is more nuanced than many of his compatriots, at the end of the day, the dragonlord sees the populace as an endless source of wealth reliant on his expertise and benevolence.</p>

			<h3>Nu Dende's Lair</h3>
			<p>The Fungal Wastes are a sprawling labyrinth of fungus choked passages, mildew covered streets and molding ruins that sits in the lower warrens. Part wild space, part personal property, and part farm, Nu only tolerates the presence of employees collecting materials within his home, and only on the outskirts. He keeps many dangerous beasts within his lair as security, protecting his secrets and labratory from corporate spies or thieves.</p>
			<h5>Lair Actions</h5>
			<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Nu takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Grasping fungal growths erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that Nu can see within 120 feet of himself. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 16 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when Nu uses this lair action again or when he dies.</li>
				<li>A wall of tangled mold bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of Nu. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall’s space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall’s space must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw once each round it’s in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall sinks back into the ground when Nu uses this lair action again or when he dies.</li>
				<li>Magical spores billows around one creature Nu can see within 120 feet of himself. The creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by Nu until initiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Regional Effects</h5>
			<p>The region around Nu's lair is warped by his presence, creating the following effects:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Thickets of hardened mold and fungus form labyrinthine passages within 1 mile of the Nu’s lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets, with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw once each round it’s in contact with the thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns. Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage.</li>
				<li>Within 1 mile of its lair, the Nu leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless he wishes to. Tracking him there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, he ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from his path.</li>
				<li>Beasts within 1 mile of the dragon’s lair serve as Nu’s eyes and ears.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If Nu dies, the beasts lose their link to him. The thickets remain, but within 1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns.</p>
