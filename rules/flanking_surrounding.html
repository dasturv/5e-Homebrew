				Variant Rule: Flanking and Surrounding
			</div>
			<p><em>In standard 5e DnD, the flanking variant rule has many issues. It provides a far too easy method of achieving advantage, nullifying many other features and abilities, and makes melee combat incredibly dangerous. The following variant rules reworks flanking into a more dynamic system.</em></p>
			<p><em>Inspiration: DnD 5e.</em></p>

			<h3>Conditions</h3>
			<p>While using this variant rule, there are multiple new conditions that are used in place of the regular flanking rules.</p>

			<h5>Threatened</h5>
			<p>A creature (the defender) is considered to be threatened by another (the aggressor) if the following is true:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The aggressor is hostile to the defender,</li>
				<li>The defender is within the reach of at least one of the aggressor's melee attacks,</li>
				<li>and the aggressor is not incapacitated.</li>
			</ul>

			<h5>Flanked</h5>
			<p>Melee attack rolls against a flanked creature gain a +2 bonus. A creature is considered flanked if the following is true:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The creature is being threatened by at least two other creatures,</li>
				<li>and at least two of these threatening creatures are on opposite sides of the threatened creature (use the normal flanking rules to decide if creatures are on opposite sides).</li>
			</ul>

			<h5>Surrounded</h5>
			<p>Melee attack rolls against a surrounded creature gain a +5 bonus. This bonus does not stack with the flanked condition. A creature is considered surrounded if the following is true:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The creature is being threatened by at least four other creatures,</li>
				<li>and at least two of these threatening creatures are on opposite sides of the threatened creature (use the normal flanking rules to decide if creatures are on opposite sides).</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Modifiers</h3>
			<p>Below are several things that modify the flanked, surrounded and threatened conditions.</p>

			<h5>Crowd Control</h5>
			<p>Not everyone is as easy to gang up on as others. Some features increase the number of threatening creatures are required for oneself to be considered flanked or surrounded, as shown on the table below.</p>

			<p><em>For example, an 11th level fighter has two extra attacks (+2) and has the polearm master feat (+1), requiring at least five creatures to be flanked, and seven creatures to be surrounded.</em></p>

			<h5>Increased Threat</h5>
			<p>Larger creatures require additional concentration to defend against than smaller ones. A large or larger aggressor counts as one additional threatening creature for each size category larger it is than the defender. A creature with the powerful build feature is considered one size category larger for this modifier.</p>

			<h5>Focused Defenses</h5>
			<p>Sometimes it makes sense to ignore lesser threats to protect oneself from a greater one. At the start of a creature's turn, they can decide to focus on a single aggressor (no action required.) Until the start of the creature's next turn, it cannot be flanked nor surrounded. During that time melee attack rolls made against it by creatures other than the one it is focusing on have advantage.</p>
