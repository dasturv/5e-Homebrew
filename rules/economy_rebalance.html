				Variant Rule: Economy Rebalance
			</div>
			<p><em>In standard 5e DnD, the amount of treasure and gold the party gets has a, relaxed nature to it. Using the rules as is, players can easily go from having nothing to having more money than they could possibly spend within a few levels. This variant rule offers more guidance on treasure as well as rebalances item costs to be more realistic.</em></p>
			
			<h3>Player Wealth</h3>
			<p>As an adventure unfolds, it is expected that the party will get wealthier, sometimes to an extreme degree. Whether through treasure looted from defeated foes, titles and gifts from happy lords or good old fashioned gold, a party will grow wealthier. And they need to! Without gold a party will struggle to update their equipment, manage the costs of living and increase their influence. Player wealth is primarily gained in the following forms:</p>

			<p><strong>Gold</strong><br>
			The simplest and most straight forward option, gold is easy to track, manage and spend.</p>

			<p><strong>Treasure</strong><br>
			While not as simple as gold, treasure items can make a world feel more alive. Artwork, precious gems and trade goods are all examples of treasure. While the party (usually) cannot spend treasure directly, it allows for wealth to be more than a simple number on a sheet.</p>

			<p><strong>Gifts</strong><br>
			Of course, being a hero comes with benefits beyond gold. Land, titles, discounts, free items and the like, while not technically costing the party anything, they still need to be considered for game balance. You can always give the party party something instead of its cost in gold.</p>

			<p>With all those options in mind, below are my guidelines for just how much gold a single player should get by the end of each level (for a total, multiply the numbers by the number of players). These numbers are simply guidelines, you don't need to push yourself to make sure the players get the exact gold in the exact levels stated below. As long as players get their wealth in the end, story matters more.</p>

			<p><strong>Starting Wealth</strong><br>
			When not starting at 1st level, players should start out with more gold. This amount is shown in the table below. Note that it is quite a bit lower than simply totalling the wealth up to that level. This bonus gold should be added alongside any other other starting gold the player has.</p>

			<div class="optional">
				<h6>Poverty and Abundance</h6>
				<p>If you want the players to feel the squeeze of poverty or the thrills of wealth, you can halve or double the base wealth values respectively.</p>

			<h3>Buying Items</h3>
			<p>The number one use of a player's wealth is purchasing equipment. As such, it is vital the obtaining said equipment is well balanced.</p>

			<h5>Catalogue</h5>
			<p>Here is a list of different types of equipment with their effects and costs.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="catalogue/adventuring_items.html">Adventuring Equipment</a></li>
				<li><a href="catalogue/armor.html">Armor</a></li>
				<li><a href="catalogue/magic_items.html">Magic Items</a></li>
				<li><a href="#">Mounts and Vehicles</a></li>
				<li><a href="catalogue/weapons.html">Weapons</a></li>
			</ul>

			<h5>Buying and Bartering</h5>
			<p>Even if you know you want something, you still need to buy it. The first step is to find someone able and willing to sell you something. In major cities it is usually easy enough to find a store that sells whatever you need (provided its legal), though in smaller towns or villages it can be much harder or even impossible. Magic items further complicate this, with rarer magic items potentially requiring an extended check to even find someone able to sell or buy, if there is any such person at all.</p>
			<p>Once you find something to buy, it isn't over yet. You need to figure out the asking price for the item. By default, items have an asking price of 1.5x their base value, though this can be modified by the player's relationship with the salesperson and other factors such as shortages or low competition. To get an exact asking price, consult the Item Price Chart below, assuming a result of 10 plus any applicable modifiers (note that the asking price does not take into consideration the player's persuasion or charisma).</p>
			<p>You can always buy an item for its asking price, but you can try to barter. To do so, make a Charisma(Persuasion) check, applying all applicable modifiers to the roll, then consult the Item Price Chart below. You can then use the bartered price instead of the asking price for that transaction.</p>

			<h5>Selling</h5>
			<p>Selling an item works the same as buying, but in reverse. When selling, consult the Sell Price column of the the Item Price Chart below.</p>

			<h5>Resale and Used Items</h5>
			<p>When attempting to sell an item to a shop owner or anyone else who as attempting to make a profit by reselling that item as is (so not a raw material), the price is half of what it would be normally. Additionally, if an item is a piece of equipment that is worn, used or otherwise in poor condition, the price is also halved.</p>

				<p>Lets go through two examples. Bert and Grot are two half-orc brothers coming into the city of Linburg looking to buy equipment and sell some loot they found on their adventures</p><br>
				<p>Bert wants to buy a nice halberd. He wanders around the city for a bit before the ringing of an anvil tips him off to a blacksmith nearby. He is welcomed into a Dwarven shop, a couple of well made polearms already on display. He asks the shop keeper for the price, and since the salesdwarf has no reason to like or dislike Bert, says the asking price is 20gp (base 20gp x1). Bert begins to barter, rolling a total of 21, bringing the multiplier down to 0.8x. Bert leaves the shop happily with his brand new, 16gp halberd.</p><br>
				<p>Grot, on the other hand, has a large gem he found to sell. He locates a jeweler's shop and make shis way in. The halfling salesperson, none to fond of orcs (half or otherwise) starts out unfriendly to poor Grot. The bigoted salesperson starts the price at 50gp (base 100gp x0.5). Not happy with the price, Grot tries haggling, rolling a terrible total of 3. Fortunately, the asking price can't go down, so he begrudgingly accepts the reduced price and leaves the shop in a sour mood.</p>
