				Variant Rule: Economy Rebalance
			</div>
			<p><em>In standard 5e DnD, the amount of treasure and gold the party gets has a, relaxed nature to it. Using the rules as is, players can easily go from having nothing to having more money than they could possibly spend within a few levels. This variant rule offers more guidance on treasure as well as rebalances item costs to be more realistic.</em></p>
			
			<h3>Player Wealth</h3>
			<p>As an adventure unfolds, it is expected that the party will get wealthier, sometimes to an extreme degree. Whether through treasure looted from defeated foes, titles and gifts from happy lords or good old fashioned gold, a party will grow wealthier. And they need to! Without gold a party will struggle to update their equipment, manage the costs of living and increase their influence. Player wealth is primarily gained in the following forms:</p>

			<p><strong>Gold</strong><br>
			The simplest and most straight forward option, gold is easy to track, manage and spend.</p>

			<p><strong>Treasure</strong><br>
			While not as simple as gold, treasure items can make a world feel more alive. Artwork, precious gems and trade goods are all examples of treasure. While the party (usually) cannot spend treasure directly, it allows for wealth to be more than a simple number on a sheet.</p>

			<p><strong>Gifts</strong><br>
			Of course, being a hero comes with benefits beyond gold. Land, titles, discounts, free items and the like, while not technically costing the party anything, need to be considered for game balance. You can always give the party party something instead of its cost in gold.</p>

			<p>With all those options in mind, below are my guidelines for just how much gold a single player should get by the end of each level (for a total, multiply the numbers by the number of players). Note that the table is split up into standard, impoverished and abundant, in case you want your party to feel the squeeze of poverty or ride high in a wealthier setting.</p>
