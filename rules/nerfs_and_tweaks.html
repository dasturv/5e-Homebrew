				Variant Rule: Nerfs and Tweaks
			</div>
			<p><em>The following rules are small tweaks and rule changes that I have come up with for balance tweaks.</em></p>

			<h3>Bonus Dice on D20 Rolls</h3>
			<p>A D20 roll (aka an ability check, attack roll or saving throw) can only have one additional die applied to it, such as those provided by the <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:bless">Bless</a> spell, bardic inspiration or combat superiority dice.</p>

			<h3>Casting Multiple Spells</h3>
			<p>You can cast multiple spells per turn. The total levels of the spells you cast cannot exceed the level of your highest level spell slot (or maximum spell level if you are using spell points). This rule does not change the casting time of any spells, and you still must have the actions and bonus actions required as normal.</p>
			<p><em>For example, a 5th level sorcerer highest level spell slot is 3. The sorcercer can cast a 3rd level spell with a cantrip, a 2nd level spell with a 1st level spell, or any combination of spells with a lower total level, provided they have enough actions and bonus actions to cast the spells.</em>

			<h3>Limited Criticals</h3>
			<p>When scoring a critical hit, only the base damage dice of the weapon are doubled. Additional damage die from features such as divine smite or sneak attack do not double, nor does damage dice from spells.</p>

			<h3>Optional Spells</h3>
			<p>Some classes have access to some additional spells:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Artificers</strong> now can learn the <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:healing-spirit">Healing Spirit</a> spell.</li>
				<li><strong>Pact of the Celestial Warlocks</strong> have the <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:flame-strike">Flame Strike</a> spell on their Celestial Expanded Spells replaced with <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mass-cure-wounds">Mass Cure Wounds</a>.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Reworked Athletics</h3>
			<p>Below are some guidelines for feats of athleticism:</p>
			<h5>Encumbrance</h5>
			<p>You can carry up to 5 times your Strength score in lbs. without penalty. If you exceed this amount you become encumbered and have your movement speeds reduced by 10 ft. If you exceed 10 times your Strength score you are heavily encumbered and have your movement speeds are reduced by a further 10 feet (for a total of 20) and you have disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws, ability checks and attack rolls. Your maximum carrying capacity is 15 times your Strength score.</p>
			<h5>Push, Pull and Lift</h5>
			<p>You are able to push, pull and lift weights up to twice your maximum carrying capacity. If pushing or pulling a weight exceeding your carrying capacity, your speed is reduced to 5 ft.</p>
			<h5>Throwing</h5>
			<p>To figure out how far you can throw an object, calculate your throwing capacity (Cap) and compare it to the table below. Your throwing capacity is equal to your strength score, plus your proficiency bonus if you have proficieny in Athletics (or double if you have expertise), and plus 5 if you have advantage on Strength or Athletics checks.</p>
			<table class="content-table">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th colspan="2">Throwing Distances</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Weight</th>
						<th>Distance</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Cap / 4</td>
						<td>40 ft.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Cap / 2</td>
						<td>30 ft.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Cap</td>
						<td>20 ft.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Cap * 2</td>
						<td>10 ft.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Cap * 4</td>
						<td>5 ft.</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>Getting at least a 10 ft. running start doubles these throwing distances.</p>
			<h5>Size</h5>
			<p>Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity, throwing capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.</p>
			<h5>Jumping</h5>
			<p>As part of your movement you can jump. You can jump a distance equal to your Strength score horizontally or 3 + your Strength modifier vertically, provided you have at least a 10 ft. run up. If you do not have the run up these distances are halved.</p>
			<p>There are several factors that can increase these distances. If you are proficient or have expertise in Athletics you may add half your proficiency bonus to your base long jump distance (or your full proficiency bonus for expertise), and 1 to your base high jump distance (or 2 for expertise). If you have advantage on Strength or Athletics checks, you add 5 to your base long jump distance and 2 to your base high jump distance.</p>

			<h3>Reworked Two-Weapon Fighting</h3>
			<p>When you make an off-hand attack while two-weapon fighting, you may make a number of off-hand attacks equal to one half the number of normal attacks you can take, rounded up, instead of the normal one.</p>
			<p>Additionally, the Two-Weapon Fighting style s replaced with the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Two-Weapon Fighting.</strong> While engaged in two-weapon fighting, you can make your off-hand attacks as part of your attack action without needing to expend a bonus action.</li>
			</ul>
