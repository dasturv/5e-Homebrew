				Variant Rule: Nerfs and Tweaks
			</div>
			<p><em>The following rules are small tweaks and rule changes that I have come up with for balance tweaks.</em></p>
			<h3>Bonus Dice on D20 Rolls</h3>
			<p>A D20 roll (aka an ability check, attack roll or saving throw) can only have one additional die applied to it, such as those provided by the <a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:bless">Bless</a> spell, bardic inspiration or combat superiority dice.</p>
			<h3>Casting Multiple Spells</h3>
			<p>You can cast multiple spells per turn. The total levels of the spells you cast cannot exceed the level of your highest level spell slot (or maximum spell level if you are using spell points). This rule does not change the casting time of any spells, and you still must have the actions and bonus actions required as normal.</p>
			<p><em>For example, a 5th level sorcerer highest level spell slot is 3. The sorcercer can cast a 3rd level spell with a cantrip, a 2nd level spell with a 1st level spell, or any combination of spells with a lower total level, provided they have enough actions and bonus actions to cast the spells.</em> 
			<h3>Limited Criticals</h3>
			<p>When scoring a critical hit, only the base damage dice of the weapon are doubled. Additional damage die from features such as divine smite or sneak attack do not double, nor does damage dice from spells.</p>
			<h3>Reworked Two-Weapon Fighting</h3>
			<p>When you make an off-hand attack while two-weapon fighting, you may make a number of off-hand attacks equal to one half the number of normal attacks you can take, rounded up, instead of the normal one.</p>
			<p>Additionally, the Two-Weapon Fighting style s replaced with the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Two-Weapon Fighting.</strong> While engaged in two-weapon fighting, you can make your off-hand attacks as part of your attack action without needing to expend a bonus action.</li>
			</ul>
