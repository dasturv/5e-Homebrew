				Lifestyles: Working and Foraging
			</div>
			<p><em>In standard 5e DnD, there is not much incentive to take care of yourself. Why sleep in a castle when roughing it in a tent provides the same benefits? The following variant rule adds a bit more complexity to this system.</em></p>
			<p><em>Inspiration: Shadowrun.</em></p>

			<h3>Working and Foraging</h3>
			<p>Sometimes, you have time between adventures where your character has some downtime. During that time, your character can work or forage to help maintain the costs of a certain lifestyle. If a result of working or foraging is a lower lifestyle level than you want, you can pay the difference to maintain a higher lifestyle level.</p>
			
			<h5>Working</h5>
			<p>In order to work, you must spend at least 5 workdays a week plying your trade. To work you must have access to a large enough settlement to warrant someone requiring your trade. At the end of downtime, make an ability check using a set of artisan tools, a musical instrument or a game set (the DM may allow you to use different proficiencies as part of your work.) You have disadvantage on this check in an impoverished community, and advantage in a richer community. Depending on the result of the check, you gain one of the following benefits as shown on the table below.</p>
			<table class="content-table">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th colspan="2">Working Results</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>DC</th>
						<th>Effects</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>10</td>
						<td>You gain the benefits of a squalid lifestyle for the time you worked.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>15</td>
						<td>You gain the benefits of a poor lifestyle for the time you worked.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>20</td>
						<td>You gain the benefits of a modest lifestyle for the time you worked. Additionally, you gain 1 sp for each week you worked.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>25</td>
						<td>You gain the benefits of a comfortable lifestyle for the time you worked. Additionally, you gain 1 gp for each week you worked.</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<h5>Foraging</h5>
			<p>In order to forage, you must spend every day of a week foraging, fishing and hunting. At the end of downtime, make a Wisdom(Survival) check. You have disadvantage on this check if the region you are in is low in natural resources, and advantage if it is abundant. Depending on the result of the check, you gain one of the following benefits as shown on the table below.</p>
			<table class="content-table">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th colspan="2">Foraging Results</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>DC</th>
						<th>Effects</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>15</td>
						<td>You gain the benefits of a squalid lifestyle for the time you foraged.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>20</td>
						<td>You gain the benefits of a poor lifestyle for the time you foraged.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>25</td>
						<td>You gain the benefits of a modest lifestyle for the time you foraged.</td>
					</tr>
