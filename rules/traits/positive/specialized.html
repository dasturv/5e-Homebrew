				Traits: Specialized
			</div>
			<p><em>Positive trait</em></p>
			<p><em>Incompatible with the Talented trait</em></p>
			<p>You've studied and practiced a particular skill, becoming an expert in it at the cost of your other studies. Perhaps you are a sort of savant, or maybe you simply put a lot of stock in a singular skill. You lose proficiency in one skill of your choice, then choose one skill in which you have proficiency. You gain expertise with that skill, which means your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with it. The skill you choose must be one that isn't already benefiting from a feature, such as Expertise, that doubles your proficiency bonus.</p>
