				Traits: Wealthy
			</div>
			<p><em>Positive trait</em></p>
			<p><em>Incompatible with the Indebted trait</em></p>
			<p>Whether due to an affluent family, a rich inheritence, canny investments or a successful business, you have a fairly continuous stream of income. Whenever you level up, or when you create your character, you gain bonus gold. The amount of gp you gain is dependent on your level and can be found on the table below. If your campaign is using an alternate level of wealth, use the modified values instead.</p>
			<table class="content-table">
				<table class="content-table">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Level</th>
						<th>Bonus gp</th>
						<th><em>Impoverished gp</em></th>
						<th><em>Abundant gp</em></th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>1st-5th</td>
						<td>25 gp</td>
						<td>15 gp</td>
						<td>30 gp</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>6th-11th</td>
						<td>75 gp</td>
						<td>30 gp</td>
						<td>100 gp</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>12th-17th</td>
						<td>125 gp</td>
						<td>75 gp</td>
						<td>200 gp</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>18th-20th</td>
						<td>300 gp</td>
						<td>125 gp</td>
						<td>500 gp</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>Depending on the events of the story, you may not gain the bonus gold immediately upon level up. the extra gold represents the profits or interest gained while you were away, and you can grab your share whenever you return to the business or to a bank connected to your source of income.</p>
			<h5>Inheritance</h5>
			<p>If the Dungeon Master allows it, you may select a single vehicle or home to start with. If you do so, you do not gain gold from this trait until the total gold you would have made with is trait exceeds the price of the chosen vehicle or home. The cost of the chosen vehicle or home should not exceed 1,000 gp. Below is a table with some potential choices, alongside the level this trait begins to provide gold again.</p>
			<table class="content-table">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Vehicle or Home</th>
						<th>Cost</th>
						<th>Level</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Carriage and Draft Horse</td>
						<td>150 gp</td>
						<td>7th</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Large House</td>
						<td>1,000 gp</td>
						<td>16th</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>If this vehicle or home is ever destroyed, the player with this trait can attempt to claim insurance on it (if applicable), allowing them to recieve gold equal to half the chosen vehicle or home's value.</p>
