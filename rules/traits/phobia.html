				Traits: Phobia
			</div>
			<p><em>Negative trait</em></p>
			<p>You have a debilitating fear of something. Perhaps you had a traumatic experience in your past with the source of your fear, or maybe it is a deep-rooted instinctual panic. Work with the Dungeon Master to choose a source of your fear. The source cannot be exceedingly rare, such as gold dragons, but also should not be everywhere, such as grass. Some examples of a phobias are: fires larger than a campfire, canine creatures, heights greater than 15 feet and spiders (including their webs). The Dungeon Master gets the final say if a specific source is appropriate for the campaign.</p>
			<p>While you can see the source of your fear, or know it is nearby if you cannot see, you suffer a -2 penalty on ability checks and attack rolls. If you make contact with or take damage from your source of fear, you instead suffer a -5 penalty on ability checks and attack rolls until the end of your next turn. If you have multiple sources of fear, you choose the closest one.</p>
