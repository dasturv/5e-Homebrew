				Traits: Compulsion
			</div>
			<p><em>Negative trait</em></p>
			<p>You have something you simply cannot live without. Perhaps you are addicted to a substance such as alcohol, or maybe you have a strange need to do a specific action such as washing yourself. The chosen compulsion should be something that requires at least a small settlement to have easy access to, and not something that can easily be found or done in the wilderness. Alternatively, a compulsion can be easy to access, but requires extended periods of time, such as needing to pray for at least two hours every morning. At the end of a long rest, if you were not able to feed compulsion in the last 24 hours, you have disadvantage on ability checks until you are able to feed your compulsion. If it has been a week since you were able to feed your compulsion, you also have disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws.</p>
