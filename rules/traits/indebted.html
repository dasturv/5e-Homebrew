				Traits: Indebted
			</div>
			<p><em>Negative trait</em></p>
			<p><em>Incompatible with the Wealthy trait</em></p>
			<p>You made some poor decisions in your past, and they are coming back to haunt you. Perhaps in a moment of desperation you turned to a criminal syndicate, or perhaps your local branch of the nation's bank was exceptionally aggressive with its loans. Either way, you owe a lot of money to some powerful people, and the amount just seems to keep growing. Whenever you level up, or when you create your character, you must give an amount of gold to your debtors. The amount of gp you must give is dependent on your level and can be found on the table below.</p>
			<p><em>Alternatively, you debtors could instead be a charity or organization you spend your hard owned gold on. Such good hearted people could be giving gold to orphanages, temples, or even a growing family. As long as the gold is gone, any flavor works.</em></p>
			<table class="content-table">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Level</th>
						<th>Payment gp</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>1st-5th</td>
						<td>50 gp</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>6th-11th</td>
						<td>500 gp</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>12th-17th</td>
						<td>2,500 gp</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>18th-20th</td>
						<td>10,000 gp</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>

			<p>Depending on the events of the story, you may not be able to pay your debts immediately upon level up. Your debtors will come looking for you if you wait to long on your payments, and nobody wants what happens if they find you.</p>
