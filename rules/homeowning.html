				Lifestyles: Homeowning
			</div>
			<p><em>In standard 5e DnD, there is not much incentive to take care of yourself. Why sleep in a castle when roughing it in a tent provides the same benefits? The following variant rule adds a bit more complexity to this system.</em></p>
			<p><em>Inspiration: Shadowrun.</em></p>

			<h3>Homeowning</h3>
			<p>Up to this point it is assumed you are renting a space to live as part of your lifestyle cost. However, owning a home can drastically save money, if you can make the upfront cost. While you live in a house, it reduces the daily cost of it's lifestyle level or lower, as shown in the New Daily cost column of the Homes table.</p> 
			<h5>Buying and Building</h5>
			<p>When buying a house, you can either purchase one or build one, provided there is a house or land for sale (this may also be limited by a local lord or other authority.) When building, the cost is reduced but house cannot be lived in until the construction time elapses. This time is paused during winters or other periods where construction cannot happen.</p>
			<h5>Capacity and Crowding</h5>
			<p>Each house has a capacity. A number of humanoids can live in a house equal to this capacity. All creatures who live in a house gain the reduced cost benefit the house provides. If more creatures live within a home than its capacity, then it becomes crowded. A crowded home has its lifestyle and daily cost benefits reduced by one level, and an additional level for two further creatures after the first.</p>
			<p>For example, a Cottage with no upgrades becomes crowded with three creatures, reducing its lifestyle to poor. If it increases to five creatures, it is reduced again to squalid.</p>
			<h5>Maintanence</h5>
			<p>Additionally, houses require maintanence. For every two upgrade slots a house has, it requires at least one work week a month in order to maintain. Failure to do so causes the house to fall into disrepair, and its lifestyle and daily cost benefits are reduced by one level. A house returns to its base benefits after a month of proper maintanence. If a house's benefits are ever reduced below squalid lifestyle, it is condemned and requires an amount of gold equal to half of its total value and half its build time in order to restore it to its base benefits. You can hire servants to maintain your house for you. Each servant increases costs 2 sp per day, and reduces the effective number of upgrade slots your house has for the purposes of calculating maintanence by 2.</p>

			<h3>Land</h3>
			<p>Homeowners oftentimes own land surrounding their home. Each home has a number of land upgrade slots, which can be used to build special upgrades. The amount of land a home has is dependent on its locale (see below.)</p>

			<h3>Locale</h3>
			<p>Where a home is greatly effects costs and build times. A home can be in an Remote, Rural or Urban locale, with the following benefits and penalties for each:</p>
			<p><strong>Remote.</strong> A Remote locale is far away from towns and cities, safe from prying eyes and meddlesome authorities. Examples include harsh mountaintops, deep in forested wilderness, or far in a hostile desert. A home in a Remote locale starts with a number of land slots equal to twice the base home's upgrade slots (Hovels and Shacks start with one land slot.) Additionally, the cost to build, buy oe upgrade the home is increased by 50%, and the build times are doubled, as the increased privacy and costs to ship in or source materials raise the costs.</p>
			<p><strong>Rural.</strong> A Rural locale is outside of a city or town, but close enough to make a day trip of it. Examples include a quiet countryside of farmlands, a forest just out of town, or an island just outside of a port city. A home in a Rural locale starts with a number of land slots equal to the base home's upgrade slots. The costs and build time for the house are unchanged.</p>
			<p><strong>Urban.</strong> An Urban locale is directly within the bounds of a city or other settlement. Examples include a small townhouse in a major city, a manor with a small yard and wall in an affluent neighborhood, or a hovel near the city's docks. A home in an Urban locale starts with a number of yard upgrade slots equal to half the base home's upgrade slots (rounded down). These yard upgrade slots are considered to be land slots that have the clear land upgrade. Additionally, the time to build the house is reduced by half, as getting access to materials and laborers is quite simple.</p>

			<h3>House Upgrades</h3>
			<p>Upon purchasing, each house contains a common room and a bedroom (except a hovel, which only contains a bedroom.) The rest of the house is made up of unfurnished rooms, represented by the house's upgrade slots. <a href="house_upgrades.html">House Upgrades</a> are specialized rooms that you can put into a house, provided it meets the upgrade's requirements and you pay the costs. Each upgrade takes up a number of upgrade slots, if you do not have enough upgrade slots, you cannot select an upgrade. Each upgrade can only be used once it is completed, which takes the amount of time specified.</p>
