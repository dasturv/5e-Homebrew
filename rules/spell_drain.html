				Variant Rule: Spell Drain
			</div>
			<p><em>In standard 5e DnD, spellcasting is quite a rigid, easily predicted system. While the spell points variant rule offers more in the way of flexibility, it still is incredibly predictable, and lacks nuance (you either have spells, or you don't). The following rule seeks to create a more dynamic and risky variant of spellcasting for DnD 5e.</em></p>
			<p><em>Inspiration: Shadowrun.</em></p>
			<h3>Spell Drain</h3>
			<p>While using this variant rule, spellcasters no longer have spell slots or spell points, instead having a drain track. Drain starts at 0 and all drain is removed when you complete a long rest. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you must make an drain check using your class's drain resistance ability (see the Drain Resistance Abilities table below). The DC for this check is 10 + the spell's level. On a success you gain no drain, on a failure you gain drain equal to the spell's level. Regardless of success or failure, you cast the spell as normal.</p>
			<p>Whenever a spellcaster casts a 6th, 7th 8th or 9th level spell, they cannot cast another spell of that level until they complete a long rest. Whenever a spellcaster is able to cast a spell without expending a spell slot, they do not need to make a drain check.</p>

			<h3>Effects of Drain</h3>
			<p>While using this variant rule, a spellcaster has three thresholds for their drain based on their spellcasting level, as shown on the Drain Thresholds by Level table below. The Drain Thresholds by Level table applies to bards, clerics, druids, sorcerers, and wizards. For a paladin or ranger, halve the character's level in that class and then consult the table. For a fighter (Eldritch Knight) or rogue (Arcane Trickster), divide the character's level in that class by three. For an Artificer, add half your levels (rounded up) in the artificer class to to determine your drain thresholds.</p>
			<p>The first time between long rests you exceed a drain threshold, you gain a number of levels of exhaustion, based on the threshold passed, as shown below. These levels of exhaustion are cumulative. for example, if you exceeded moderate drain, you would gain 2 levels of exhaustion, for a total of 3 (1 level from exceeding minimal drain earlier).</p>

			<h3>Drain Recovery</h3>
			<p>Certain features and items, such as a wizard's arcane recovery feature or mana potions allow spellcasters to recover spell slots. While using this variant rule, whenever a spellcaster would recover spell slots, they instead reduce their drain by the total level of all the recovered spell slots.</p>
			<h3>Metamagic and Sorcery Points</h3>
			<p>While using this variant rule, sorcerers do not have sorcery points. Instead, whenever they apply metamagic to a spell, it increases the drain check DC and drain for that spell if you fail by the amount of sorcery points that would have been spent. If a sorcerer applies metamagic to a cantrip, they must make a drain check for that spell (the cantrip's base level is 0).</p>
			<p>If a sorcerer uses a feature that expends sorcery points but is not metamagic, they must make a drain check (DC 10 + amount of sorcery points that would have been spent). On a failure they take drain equal to the amount of sorcery points that feature would have cost.</p>
			<p>While using this variant rule, Sorcerers increase each of their drain thresholds by one half of their sorcerer level (rounded down).</p>
