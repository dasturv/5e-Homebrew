			<p>Adventurers need a lot more than just their weapons and armor. Food, bedding, shelter, entertainment, tools and more are all important things to bring when leaving the comforts of civilization. Below are several tables of items players can purchase to aid them throughout an adventure.</p>

			<h5>Equipment Packs</h5>
			<p>In addition to the items below, there are things called equipment packs. Equipment packs offer many items in a bundle and have a reduced cost. Players can usually only purchase equipment packs upon character creation, though DMs may choose to have them offered later by merchants as a special deal or rewards.</p>
