				Variant Rule: Brutal Damage
			</div>
			<p><em>In standard 5e DnD, damage and death are very forgiving. Being knocked unconsious is only 1 hp away from getting back into the fight, none the worse off, with only focused aggression from multiple enemies, a truly absurd damaging attack or a drawn out gamble of death saving throws truly putting a player down. Such mechanics allow and even at times prioritize reckless play, with little to no consequences and tension for the players. With the following rules, you can make combat encounters more intense, and smart play far more important.</em></p>
			<p><em>Inspiration: previous editions.</em></p>
			<h3>Negative Hit Points</h3>
			<p>When using this variant rule, a player's hit points can be reduced to negative numbers, not just 0. A creature does not gain consciousness until it has more than 0 hit points. If a creature ever has less than half it's maximum hit points in negative hit points, it dies.</p>
			<h3>Injuries</h3>
			<p>Additionally, while using this variant rule, taking massive damage or being reduced to 0 hit points leaves lasting effects, and sometimes even permanent ones. Whenever a player takes massive damage (a instance of damage equal to or greater than half their maximum hit points) or is reduced to 0 hit points, they recieve a short term injury. You can either roll on the table below or select a fitting injury from it. Whenever a player with an injury recovers hit points, they can spend 10 of those hit points to instead remove one injury. The spent hit points are not restored.</p>
			<h3>Scars</h3>
			<p>Whenever a player removes a short term injury caused by them being reduced to 0 hit points, they replace it with a long term injury. You can either roll on the table below or select a fitting injury from it. A long term injury can only be removed by casting regenerate on a player character once a day for a week or via the wish spell.</p>
