				Variant Rule: Traits
			</div>
			<p><em>Standard DnD 5e's character creation process is incredibly deep... to a point. Compared to many other editions and systems, it is downright simple (as it was designed to be). However, using these rules, a bit more flavor and character can be built into player characters right form the start, granting both strengths and weaknesses to play around with.</em></p>
			<p><em>Inspiration: OneDnD.</em></p>
			<h3>Boons and Flaws</h3>
			<p>When using this variant rules, characters gain a number of traits, small bonuses and penalties that work similarly to feats. Upon character creation a player character has one positive trait from the options below. Additionally, when making a character a player may choose to take a negative trait to be able to take an additional positive trait, up to twice (a total of 5 traits, 3 positive and 2 negative).</p>
			<p>Some traits have prequisites, such as spellcasting, and others have incompatible traits. A player cannot choose a trait when they already have on that is incompatible with it. The DM can always override a player's choice in traits if they believe the trait(s) chosen would not be impactful enough in play.</p>
