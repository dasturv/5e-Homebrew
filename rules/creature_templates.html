				Creature Templates
			</div>
			<p><em>In standard 5e DnD, there are very few creature templates. The following sections are designed to offer more options for diverse creatures.</em></p>
			<h3>Applying Templates</h3>
			<p>Templates can be applied to any creature, with the creature gaining all the features of said template, and its challenge rating (CR) increasing by a specified amount. A creature below CR 1 becomes the specified CR instead. Some features increase attribute scores. When this occurs, you may need to recalculate the creature's hit points, armor class, attack rolls, damage rolls and save DCs.</p>
