				Disease: Mindfire
			</div>

			<p>Mindfire is a disease that is characterized by intense fevers and confusion in those who are suffering from it. While rarely dangerous, a few unfortunate souls can suffer long term effects that impair their ability to remember and use logic.</p>

			<h5>Infection</h5>
			<p>Mindfire is spread predominantly through inhalation. A non-infected humanoid has a 10% chance of being exposed each hour they spend within 20 feet of an infected creature. An exposed creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected. A creature that wears a mask while at risk of exposure has advantage on this save.</p>

			<h5>Stage 0 (Incubation)</h5>
			<p><strong>Identify Check:</strong> DC 25 Wisdom (Medicine).</p>
			<p>The disease progresses onto its next stage after 1d4 days.</p>

			<h5>Stage 1 (Early Symptoms)</h5>
			<p><strong>Identify Check:</strong> DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine).</p>
			<p>An infected creature at this stage gains a level of exhaustion.</p>
			<p>The disease progresses onto its next stage after 1d4 days.</p>

			<h5>Stage 2 (Illness)</h5>
			<p><strong>Identify Check:</strong> DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine).</p>
			<p>An infected creature at this stage gains an additional level of exhaustion (for a total of 2). Additionally, the infected creature's Intelligence is reduced by 2 (minimum of 1).</p>
			<p>The disease progresses onto its next stage after 1d6 days.</p>

			<h5>Stage 3 (Decline)</h5>
			<p><strong>Identify Check:</strong> DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine).</p>
			<p>An infected creature at this stage gains an additional level of exhaustion (for a total of 3). Additionally, the infected creature's Intelligence is reduced by 5 (minimum of 1).</p>
