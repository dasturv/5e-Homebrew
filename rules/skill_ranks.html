				Variant Rule: Skill Ranks
			</div>
			<p><em>In standard 5e DnD, skills are a binary. Either you are proficient, or you are not. This variant rule seeks to remedy this by allowing a more flexible way to show a character's growth and abilities.</em></p>
			<p><em>Inspiration: DnD 3.5, Fallout New Vegas.</em></p>
			<h3>Skill Ranks</h3>
			<p>While using this variant rule, every aspect of skills and proficiency changes drastically. As such, I will explore this rule in three parts: using skills, character creation and skill improvement.</p>

			<h5>Using Skills</h5>
			<p>Characters no longer gain proficiency with skills and tools. Instead, each skill or tool has a rank. When a player makes a check using a skill or tool, they add the corresponding rank. Ranks start at 0 until increased.</p>
			<p>Some features require proficiency with skills or tools. For the purposes of those features, a character is considered proficient if they have at least 1 rank in the corresponding skill or tool. Some other features interact with profiency in unique ways and work differently while using this rule, as listed below:</p>

			<p><strong>Expertise</strong><br>
			For any ability check you make using a skill or tool in which you have expertise, the corresponding rank is doubled.</p>

			<p><strong>Jack of All Trades</strong><br>
			Whenever you make an ability check, the bonus provided by the corresponding rank(s) cannot be lower than half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). This does not increase the actual rank.</p>

			<p>When making an ability check that could use both a skill and a tool, you may add both of the corresponding ranks to the total, with a maximum bonus equal to your proficiency bonus. If both corresponding ranks are equal to your proficiency bonus, you gain advantage on that roll.</p>

			<h5>Character Creation</h5>
			<p>When you would assign skill and tool proficiencies to a new character, you instead follow these steps:</p>

			<p><strong>Calculate Skill Points</strong><br>
			You start with a number of skill points based on your class (as shown on the Class Skills table), plus any bonus skill points from racial features, traits or feats.</p>

			<p><strong>Create your Skill Pool</strong><br>
			Your skill pool is based on your class (as shown on the Class Skills table), plus any additional skills from racial features, traits or feats.</p>
