				Variant Rule: Reputation and Relationships
			</div>
			<p><em>In standard 5e DnD, the social aspects of NPCs are mostly kept vague, with little to no system to keep track of NPC's attitudes towards the players besides the potential notes taken by the DM. Using these variant rules, NPC attitudes can be standardized while still being intuitive and flexible.</em></p>
			
			<h3>Relationships</h3>
			<p>It is often easy to forget how specific NPCs feel about other characters, especially when considering dozens of interactions, gossip, and the DMs emotional state during any session. As such, for NPCs with whom the party will often interact with, keeping a brief description of their relationship can be useful. Something short (I recommend 2-4 words) that describes how the NPC sees the player(s) is all you need, such as "good-natured troublemakers", "stoic guardians", "bumbling vagrants" or "exploitable pawns".</p>
			<p>An NPC can have a relationship with the entire party, a singular player (especially useful for very important NPCs), or both.</p>

			<h3>Changing Relationships</h3>
			<p>Relationships are rarely static, but just getting someone to like you more isn't easy. When using this rule, an NPC's relationship doesn't change unless the player(s) or another force does something to change it. For example, helping a merchant with a string of events may lead him to see the party as "kindly folks", but just continuing to help with odd chores is unlikely to change that. However, if the party defends his shop in a raid he may begin seeing them as "kindly guardians", whereas if he caught them stealing from him he may see them as "opportunistic con-artists".</p>

			<h3>Reputation</h3>
			<p>Of course, people don't just form opinions of you based on just your interactions. Players can also have a reputation that expands beyond their immediate relationships. Whether they make a name for themselves within an organization, location or even on the global scale, the players can become quite well known. Gaining a reputation should be quite a bit more difficult than building a relationship with an NPC, with groups being the easiest, followed by locations (with smaller locales being easier than larger ones) then finally a global reputation. For example, a party may have a reputation as "reliable agents" by a thieve's guild, "dangerous criminals" by a capital city, and "daring vigilantes" by the world at large.</p>
			<p>Just like NPC relationships, the party's reputation should only change if something occurs to change what the group/location/global populace would think of them. Additionally, reputation takes time to grow and change, as words of the party's deeds slowly get spread, with greater deeds spreading faster than minor ones.</p>

			<div class="optional">
				<h6>Effects of Reputation</h6>
				<p>Reputation itself does not directly provide any benefits or penalties, instead acting as a modifier for individual relationships. An NPC that likes the party may start getting second thoughts if they hear rumors that they slaughtered a family, whereas a hardened criminal with no opinion of the party may respect them if he hears they busted out of prison.</p>
			</div>

			<p>Benefits and Penalties</p>
			<p>Having relationships with NPCs can provide a wide swath of benefits and penalties. An NPC who trusts the players may be easier to persuade or decieve, whereas an NPC that sees the party as incompetent may be harder to intimidate. What specific bonuses or penalties are applied are up to the DM, but below are some examples of relationships and their effects.</p>
