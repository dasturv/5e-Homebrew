				Variant Rule: Diseases
			</div>
			<p><em>In standard 5e DnD, diseases are rarely used and even more rarely fleshed out. Using these variant rules, disease becomes a more persistant threat that requires time and skill to avoid.</em></p>

			<h3>Infection</h3>
			<p>Diseases are spread in many ways. Bacteria, fungus, and viruses can be spread from the infected or the environment to the healthy, as well as more magical means such as spells, curses and fiends. Each disease has a specific vector of infection, with an associated save, that can be found in its description. When a creature first becomes infected, the disease starts at stage 0 and ends at stage 4, unless otherwise noted.</p>

			<h3>Progressing a Disease</h3>
			<p>Each disease has stages, or phases of the disease with different effects and penalties. Each stage has an associated extended check. A creature has all the effects of its current stage for as long as the associated extended check is underway. If a creature fails the extended check, the disease progresses to the next stage. If the infected creature succeeds on the extended check, they will either begin to recover (see below) unless otherwise noted.</p>

			<h3>Identifying a Disease</h3>
			<p>In order to properly treat a disease, you must first identify what it is (and if a creature is infected). Each stage of a disease has an associated check to identify it. 

			<h3>Treating a Disease</h3>
			<p>While a creature can passively recover from a disease using their saves, it is oftentimes much safer to treat the disease whenever possible. Creatures (including the infected themselves) can help an infected creature with a disease's extended check using Wisdom (Medicine) check, though some diseases use other checks to treat. Treatment checks are made with disadvantage if the disease is not identified.</p>
			<p>Magic can also be used to treat diseases, with varying results based on the disease. Specifically, these spells do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong><a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:lesser-restoration">Lesser Restoration.</a></strong> Instead of ending a disease, the infected creature instead automatically succeeds on its current stage's extended check.</li>
				<li><strong><a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:greater-restoration">Greater Restoration.</a></strong> Instead of one of the other effects, you can choose to cause one disease effecting the target to end, causing them to immediately begin recovery.</li>
				<li><strong><a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:heal">Heal.</a></strong> The target gains a bonus to any current disease extended checks equal to half the amount of hit points restored by this spell.</li>
				<li><strong><a href="https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mass-heal">Mass Heal.</a></strong> Each target gains a bonus to any current disease extended checks equal to the amount of hit points they recovered from this spell.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Recovering from a Disease</h3>
			<p>Once a creature successfully removes a disease, either through magic or succeeding on one of the disease's extended checks, they oftentimes need time to recover their strength afterwards. Any exhaustion caused by the disease doesn't end with it, requiring removal as normal.</p>
