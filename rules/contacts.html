				Variant Rule: Contacts
			</div>
			<p><em>In standard 5e DnD, characters from player's backstories tend to be rather, unimpactful outside of key story moments. This variant rule aims to remedy this by adding a new type of npc: contacts.</em></p>
			<p><em>Inspiration: Shadowrun.</em></p>
			<h3>What is a Contact</h3>
			<p>A contact is someone that the player character knows and that can provide useful services or influence. Not every person a player has met is a contact, and contacts are not added after character creation (instead, use the normal rules for social interaction). Contacts are solely to flesh out and provide benefits for the player's past connections.</p>

			<h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
			<p>Upon character creation, players gain a number of Contact Points (CP) to spend on creating contacts. a player gains a number of these points equal to the Charisma score. Each contact has an influence and a loyalty score, and their cost in CP increases with these two scores, as shown on the tables below. A contact's total cost cannot exceed half of the players Charisma score (rounded down).</p>

			<h3>Interacting with Contacts</h3>
			<p>A contact is just like any other character. They have their own wants, needs and goals, with contacts of higher influence being harder to get a hold of and having more complicated needs. If a player betrays the trust given to them, or aids the contact in some way, their attitude score increases and decreases just as any other npc. Failure to maintain a contact can lead them to slip away, losing the benefits they provided.</p>
