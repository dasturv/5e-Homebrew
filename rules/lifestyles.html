				Variant Rule: Lifestyles
			</div>
			<p><em>In standard 5e DnD, there is not much incentive to take care of yourself. Why sleep in a castle when roughing it in a tent provides the same benefits? The following variant rule adds a bit more complexity to this system.</em></p>
			<p><em>Inspiration: Shadowrun.</em></p>
			<h3>Lifestyles</h3>
			<p>When using this variant rule you must spend coin in order to maintain your lifestyle. Choose one of the lifestyle levels below. Each lifestyle level has a daily cost you must spend in order to maintain it. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effects of your maintained lifestyle level, provided you have maintained it for at least a week. If you have maintained multiple lifestyles in the past week, you gain the benefit of their average level (rounded down.)</p>

			<h3>Working and Foraging</h3>
			<p>Sometimes, you have time between adventures where your character has some downtime. During that time, your character can work or forage to help maintain the costs of a certain lifestyle. If a result of working or foraging is a lower lifestyle level than you want, you can pay the difference to maintain a higher lifestyle level.</p>
			
			<h5>Working</h5>
			<p>In order to work, you must spend at least 5 workdays a week plying your trade. To work you must have access to a large enough settlement to warrant someone requiring your trade. At the end of downtime, make an ability check using a set of artisan tools, a musical instrument or a game set (the DM may allow you to use different proficiencies as part of your work.) You have disadvantage on this check in an impoverished community, and advantage in a richer community. Depending on the result of the check, you gain one of the following benefits as shown on the table below.</p>
			<table class="content-table">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th colspan="2">Working Results</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>DC</th>
						<th>Effects</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>10</td>
						<td>You gain the benefits of a squalid lifestyle for the time you worked.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>15</td>
						<td>You gain the benefits of a poor lifestyle for the time you worked.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>20</td>
						<td>You gain the benefits of a modest lifestyle for the time you worked. Additionally, you gain 1 sp for each week you worked.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>25</td>
						<td>You gain the benefits of a comfortable lifestyle for the time you worked. Additionally, you gain 1 gp for each week you worked.</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<h5>Foraging</h5>
			<p>In order to forage, you must spend every day of a week foraging, fishing and hunting. At the end of downtime, make a Wisdom(Survival) check. You have disadvantage on this check if the region you are in is low in natural resources, and advantage if it is abundant. Depending on the result of the check, you gain one of the following benefits as shown on the table below.</p>
			<table class="content-table">

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>25</td>
						<td>You gain the benefits of a modest lifestyle for the time you foraged.</td>
					</tr>

			<h3>Travelling</h3>
			<p>Oftentimes you have to leave your home and lifestyle and travel, which is never as comfortable. While travelling you must have access to shelter, food, sleep and water.

			<h3>Homeowning</h3>
			<p>Up to this point it is assumed you are renting a space to live as part of your lifestyle cost. However, owning a home can drastically save money, if you can make the upfront cost. While you live in a house, it reduces the daily cost of it's lifestyle level or lower, as shown in the New Daily cost column of the Homes table.</p> 
			<p>When buying a house, you can either purchase one or build one, provided there is a house or land for sale (this may also be limited by a local lord or other authority.) When building, the cost is reduced but house cannot be lived in until the construction time elapses. This time is paused during winters or other periods where construction cannot happen.</p>
			<p>Each house has a capacity. A number of humanoids can live in a house equal to this capacity. All creatures who live in a house gain the reduced cost benefit the house provides.</p>
			<p>Additionally, houses require maintanence. For every two upgrade slots a house has, it requires at least one work week a month in order to maintain. Failure to do so causes the house to fall into disrepair, and its lifestyle and daily cost benefits are reduced by one level. A house returns to its base benefits after a month of proper maintanence. If a house's benefits are ever reduced below squalid lifestyle, it is condemned and requires an amount of gold equal to half of its total value and half its build time in order to restore it to its base benefits. You can hire servants to maintain your house for you. Each servant increases costs 2 sp per day, and reduces the effective number of upgrade slots your house has for the purposes of calculating maintanence by 2.</p>

			<h3>House Upgrades</h3>
			<p>Upon purchasing, each house contains a common room and a bedroom (except a hovel, which only contains a bedroom.) The rest of the house is made up of unfurnished rooms, represented by the house's upgrade slots. House upgrades are specialized rooms that you can put into a house, provided it meets the upgrade's requirements and you pay the costs. Each upgrade takes up a number of upgrade slots, if you do not have enough upgrade slots, you cannot select an upgrade. Each upgrade can only be used once it is completed, which takes the amount of time specified.</p>

When you built this upgrade, you can spend an additional 50 gp to increase both DCs by 2, to a max of 30 and 36 respectively. Furthermore, you can spend an additional 100 gp to ward the room, preventing the room from being targeted by divination magic, percieved through magical scrying sensor and prevents magical teleportation within its borders.</p><br>

The yard must be maintained, using the same rules as a house except that when a yard falls into disrepair, it instead loses one of its upgrade slots to overgrowth. While an upgrade slot is overgrown, any upgrades on it cannot be used until the yard is maintained. If a yard loses its last upgrade slot to overgrowth, itself and all of its upgrades are lost permanently and you must purchase and build the yard again.</p>
