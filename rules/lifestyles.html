				Variant Rule: Lifestyles
			</div>
			<p><em>In standard 5e DnD, there is not much incentive to take care of yourself. Why sleep in a castle when roughing it in a tent provides the same benefits? The following variant rule adds a bit more complexity to this system.</em></p>
			<p><em>Inspiration: Shadowrun.</em></p>
			<h3>Lifestyles</h3>
			<p>When using this variant rule you must spend coin in order to maintain your lifestyle. Choose one of the lifestyle levels below. Each lifestyle level has a daily cost you must spend in order to maintain it. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effects of your maintained lifestyle level, provided you have maintained it for at least a week. If you have maintained multiple lifestyles in the past week, you gain the benefit of their average level (rounded down.)</p>

						<td><em>You live a life of plenty and comfort. You never go hungry nor thirsty, and have access to the best food and lodging your community can provide. Large homes, fine dining, skilled tailors, expansive retinues of servants attending your every need. You have access to the richest and most powerful people around, such as politicians, guild leaders, high priests and nobility (and all the treachery that comes with them.)</em></td>
						<td>You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to three times your proficiency bonus.</td>
