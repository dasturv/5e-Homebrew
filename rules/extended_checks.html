				Variant Rule: Extended Checks
			</div>
			<p><em>In standard 5e DnD, a DMs options for portraying actions that take time  is limited. Using a single check has the chance to waste a lot of time, and series of checks make every failure wasteful and sometimes even harmful. This variant rule adds another way to measure progress that isn't as punishing but still rewards high skills.</em></p>
			<p><em>Inspiration: Shadowrun.</em></p>
			<h3>Making an Extended Check</h3>
			<p>An extended check is extremely similar to a standard check, with two noticeable differences. First, an extended check has an interval, the amount of time between each roll made for it. At the end of each interval, the player(s) making the check rolls the check again. Second, when a roll is made on an extended test and that roll fails, you reduce the DC of the check by the roll.</p>
			<h3>Failing an Extended Check</h3>
			<p>For many extended checks, such as building a machine or translating ancient text, progress isn't lost when the player steps away or takes longer than expected. Of course, this is not always the case. Take to long brewing a potion and the ingredients may burn, or a magic lock may realign itself to thwart a master thief. Such checks may have a time limit, after which progress is lost.</p>
			<h3>Working Together</h3>
			<p>Some extended checks may allow multiple characters to work together on the check, such as building a stone wall. In such cases, each interval every helping character makes the roll, reducing the DC for the check for everyone.</p>
			<h3>Complex Checks</h3>
			<p>Sometimes, more than one skill is needed for a task. In such cases, use mutliple extended checks. During each interval, each character can roll for one of the extended checks, and the task is complete once all extended checks succeed.</p>
			<p>To design an extended check, use the tables below to help decide upon the starting DC and the interval for the extended check.</p>
