				Better Vehicles
			</div>
			<p><em>In standard 5e DnD, vehicles tend to be more for flavor than an actual important decision for a party. Using these variant rules, players have more in depth rules for vehicles as well as aility to customize and personalize their vehicles.</em></p>
			<p><em>Inspiration: Shadowrun.</em></p>

			<h3>Vehicles</h3>
			<p>All vehicles have a list of attributes and characteristics unique to them, as detailed below:</p>
			<h5>Armor Class, Hit Points and Damage Thresholds</h5>
			<p>Every vehicle has an armor class and hit points that function the same as it does for creatures. A vehicle that is reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed. Some larger vehicles have multiple sets of armor class and hit points, each representing a smaller portion of the vehicle. If a part is reduced to 0 hit points and destroyed, it may have additional effects. If a vehicle has a damage threshold, it has immunity to any individual source of damage below that threshold.</p>
			<h5>Size</h5>
			<p>Each vehicle takes up a specified amount of space. The measurement is in the format of length x width x height.</p>
			<h5>Crew</h5>
			<p>Every vehicle has a minimum number of creatures required to control and steer it. Some vehicles may continue to move while not crewed, such as a cart pulled by a mule or a sailing ship in the wind. If a vehicle has less than the minimum number of crew members, then any check to steer or control the vehicle is made with disadvantage.</p>
			<h5>Movement Speed and Maneuverability</h5>
			<p>All vehicles have at least one speed, and many have multiple, each requiring specific requirements to obtain. Additionally, each vehicle has a maneuverability score, which represents the number of rounds it takes a vehicle to turn 90 degrees at full speed.</p>
			<h5>Cargo</h5>
			<p>Each vehicle has a maximum amount of cargo it can carry, measured in volume.</p>

			<h3>Land Vehicles</h3>
			<p>Here are the options for land vehicles:</p>

			<!-- Cart -->
			<h5>Cart (15 gp)</h5>
			<p>Carts are small wooden vehicles designed to haul cargo and lacks any roofing. Oftentimes lightweight and cheap, they are truly utility first.
